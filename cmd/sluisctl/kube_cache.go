// The kubectl token cache exists for the reason the AWS one does: an exec
// plugin is not called once.
//
// kubectl runs the plugin in every kubectl process that has no cached
// credential of its own, so each one asks the issuer. A refresh SPENDS the
// refresh token (internal/issuer/storage.go): the first process to finish
// rotates it, and every other one is left holding a token the issuer
// refuses with "the refresh token is not live" -- which this command
// reports as "not signed in". The session ends for EVERY audience at once,
// not only for the caller that lost the race, and the operator is signed
// out in the middle of a command they did not think was a sign-in.
//
// Two at once is ordinary rather than exotic: a script looping over
// contexts, a cluster watch beside a terminal, a console beside kubectl, a
// provider's kubernetes client beside anything else. Measured 2026-09-22:
// one loop polling three clusters every thirty seconds, beside a
// foreground kubectl on a fourth, ended the session within the hour.
//
// The cache is advisory in every direction -- absent, truncated,
// unreadable, expired, unwritable all mean mint afresh, none fail -- and
// the lock beside it (cache_lock.go) is what turns a cold start by eight
// callers into one refresh rather than eight.

// kubeCacheMargin is how long before expiry a cached token stops being
// offered. client-go re-runs the plugin once `expirationTimestamp` has
// passed and not before, so this has to cover the API call the credential
// is about to make and no more: a wider margin would throw away most of
// the life of a token from a client with a short lifetime cap.
const kubeCacheMargin = time.Minute

// kubeCachePath names the file for one issuer, client and audience.
//
// All three decide what the token is -- the same audience at another
// issuer, or presented by another client, is a different credential -- and
// a key that left one out would hand back somebody else's token. Hashed
// because an issuer is a URL and an audience is `k8s:<cluster>`, neither
// of which is a filename.
