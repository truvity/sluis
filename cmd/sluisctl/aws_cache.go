// The AWS credential cache exists because `credential_process` is not
// called once.
//
// A provider-based tool resolves credentials in EVERY provider process it
// starts, each with its own in-memory cache, so each one runs this command.
// Pulumi's `aws` stack for one estate declares four providers; Terraform
// and the AWS CLI's own sub-processes behave the same way. Without a shared
// cache that is four sign-in refreshes racing each other.
//
// THAT RACE DESTROYS THE SESSION, which is why this is a correctness fix
// rather than a speed one. A refresh SPENDS the old token (see
// internal/issuer/storage.go): the first process to finish rotates it, and
// every other process is then holding a token the issuer will refuse with
// "the refresh token is not live". The operator is signed out, and the AWS
// SDK -- having got nothing from us -- falls through to the rest of its
// chain, so the failure surfaces as somebody else's credentials being
// wrong. Measured 2026-09-22 on a four-provider stack: every run, and the
// reported error named an unrelated SSO profile.
//
// The cache is keyed by what determines the credential and nothing else,
// written 0600 beside the session, and treated as advisory throughout: any
// error reading it means mint afresh, never fail.

// awsCacheMargin is how long before expiry a cached credential stops being
// offered. The AWS SDK refreshes its own copy around five minutes out, so
// anything shorter hands back a credential the caller is about to discard,
// and anything much longer wastes the tail of a perfectly good one.
