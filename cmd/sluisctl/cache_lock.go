// A cache alone does not fix the race the caches exist for, and this is
// the part that does. On a cold start every caller misses at the same
// instant and they all refresh together -- which is exactly the situation
// that spends the rotating refresh token once per caller. The lock makes
// one of them do the work while the others wait, and they then find the
// answer already written.
//
// The lock is its own file, not the cache file, so the atomic rename that
// replaces the cache cannot pull the lock out from under a waiter.
//
// Shared by the AWS credential cache (aws_cache.go) and the kubectl token
// cache (kube_cache.go): both are one file per credential, and the way
// they are raced is the same.

// lockFile and unlockFile are the one part of this that is not portable,

// is built for Windows deliberately -- the credential helpers are what
// kubectl and the AWS SDKs run, and both exist there -- and `go build`
// for the host platform never says so: the first thing to notice was a
// release, which failed at `syscall.Flock` for windows/arm64 with the
// change already on master.
