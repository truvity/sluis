# Every link in the built site, internal and external (lychee.toml). Needs `just site-build`.
#
# lychee has been seen to run for ever without a line of output (2026-11-01, every run of
# the job for 20 minutes until its timeout), and `--no-progress` left nothing to say on
# which link. Each try is bounded to 4 minutes (a normal run takes well under one), is
# verbose so that the log names the link it stopped at, and a try that hit the bound is
# repeated, twice. A run that ends in lychee's own verdict (a dead link) is not repeated.
#
# lychee writes a JSON report and site/scripts/links-report.mjs judges it. lychee sends one
# request for a 5xx (its max_retries covers network errors and timeouts only, with a growing
# wait), so the links of an external host that failed on a 5xx, a network error or a timeout
# are checked again here, after 15 s and then 45 s. What still fails then depends on
# SLUIS_LINKS_MODE (strict when unset; the Checks workflow sets lenient for a pull request and
# the merge queue, strict for main):
#   lenient: a 5xx, a network error or a timeout from an external host is a warning, reported
#            and not failing (kubernetes.io failed four pull requests on 2026-11-06 and passed
#            on a rerun);
#   strict:  a 5xx from github.com or raw.githubusercontent.com is a warning (those hosts
#            answered 504 to CI runners on 2026-11-05 for pages that loaded a moment later);
#            a 5xx from another host, a network error and a timeout fail.
# In both: a 4xx (a 404, a 410) and every internal link fail.

# starts no download. That setting is the fix of "detected conflict: 'bin/cargo-clippy'" (2026-11): the python package of devbox
# makes .venv on the first `devbox run` of a checkout, and pip runs `rustc --version` with a timeout of 0.5 s to put the
# compiler in its user agent. In this directory that `rustc` is rustup's, and rustup installed the pinned toolchain by itself;
# pip killed it half way, which left bin/cargo-clippy without rustup's record of it, and the next install said "downloading 4
# components" and failed (a new worktree, or a CI job that starts with .venv missing: about one in fifty jobs).
#
# It is safe to run at any time and in parallel: a complete toolchain is a check of a fraction of a second; one that is not
# complete is installed under a lock, by one process at a time; a half-made one (a killed install, an older checkout) is named,
