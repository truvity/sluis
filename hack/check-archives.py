"""Every archive must hold the same binaries on every platform it ships.

goreleaser refuses to publish an archive whose contents differ by
platform, and it refuses at the ARCHIVES stage -- after four minutes of
cross-compiling, and only when a tag is pushed. That is how v0.12.0 was
cut and published nothing: sluisctl is the one binary built for Windows,
so the Windows archive held one where every other held four.

`goreleaser check` does not catch it and `goreleaser build
--single-target` never reaches archives, so this is the guard that runs
in `just check`. It reads the same file goreleaser reads and needs no
compiler.

No dependency on PyYAML: the config is read with a tiny parser for the
two shapes this file uses, so a runner with a bare python3 can run it.
