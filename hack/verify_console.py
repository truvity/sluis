"""Walk one proxied console through sign-in, sign-out and revocation.

WHY THIS EXISTS: the last three sign-out defects all lived in the PROXY
CHAIN, and no unit test reaches it. `/end_session` ended the sign-in
without revoking what the browser opened; the merged service had no
source for the sign-out URL; and `ttl_cap` was applied on token exchange
and nowhere else, so the window in which a revoked session kept working
was the deployment default. Each was found by a person in a browser,
reported, and only then reproduced. This is that person, automated.

It asserts five things, in the order a person meets them:

  1. an unauthenticated visit reaches the issuer, not the application
  2. after signing in, the application serves AND the issuer lists the
     session it opened
  3. signing out THROUGH THE PROXY -- what the Sign out button does --
     ends the sign-in and every session under it, and the next visit
     asks again at once, because nothing is left to notice later
  4. signing out AT THE ISSUER -- the console's "Sign out all" -- stops
     the application within the proxy's refresh interval, because the
     issuer answers the next refresh with invalid_grant and oauth2-proxy
     treats that as fatal
  5. REVOKING one session with the sign-in left standing REPLACES it: the
     proxy's refresh fails, it starts a new sign-in, the standing sign-in
     admits it silently, and a fresh session appears where the old one
     was. Revoke is not sign-out, and the Sessions page says so.

The first version of this asserted that a sign-out at the issuer stops
a proxied console immediately, and that a revoke stops it at all. Both
were wrong about the design rather than about the code: the proxy's
cookie is on another host and survives an issuer sign-out, and a revoke
leaves the sign-in that admits the next visit. The run that showed it
had every issuer-side fact right and reported two failures anyway.

Usage:
  ISSUER=<issuer> CONTEXT=<kubectl context> RECOVERY_IDENTITY=<subject> \
    hack/verify_console.py <host> [--client <id>]

Sign-in is RECOVERY, the audited break-glass path, which is why this runs
unattended. The identity must hold a group the client's `requires` names
or the issuer will refuse it -- that refusal is a correct answer, not a
failure of this script, and it says so.
