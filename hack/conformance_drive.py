"""Run a conformance plan end to end in headless Chrome.

WHY A BROWSER IS REQUIRED, having tried without one: the suite's callback
is an HTML page that posts the result back to the suite with JavaScript.
`curl` follows every redirect, reaches that page, and never runs it — so
the authorization completes, the suite is never told, and the module sits
in WAITING until the next one interrupts it. That reads as a hang and is
the reason a plan showed a row of grey boxes.

Signing in is not a person at a Google prompt. That is what makes thirty
modules unattended. On Kubernetes it is RECOVERY, the audited break-glass
path, which the issuer logs at WARN on every use: the proof is a ServiceAccount
token the cluster vouches for (RECOVERY=kubernetes, the default). Anywhere else
it is the CONFORMANCE test account (RECOVERY=password): a username and password
that the page's script proves to the issuer with SRP and never sends
(docs/decisions/0076). The installation must have turned it on for the run
(`conformance.enabled`), and the plan's clients must carry `harness: true`.
The account holds no group and signs in to no other client.

The sign-in is re-established WHENEVER the issuer asks for one, not once
at the start, because the logout modules exist to end it — a driver that
cached a session would pass them by accident.

Usage:
  hack/conformance_drive.py <plan-id> [--from <module>] [--only <module>] [--manual]

  SUITE      the suite's URL (default https://localhost.emobix.co.uk:8443)
  ISSUER     the issuer under test (required)
  RECOVERY   kubernetes (default) or password (the conformance account)
  CONTEXT    kubernetes: the kubectl context of the issuer's cluster
  KUBECTL    kubernetes: how to run kubectl
  NAMESPACE, SERVICE_ACCOUNT, AUDIENCE
             kubernetes: the recovery account (defaults access-issuer,
             access-issuer-recovery, access-issuer-recovery)
  RECOVERY_PASSWORD_CMD
             password: a command, run without a shell, whose output is the
             conformance account's password, for example
             "sluisctl recovery password --account conformance --instance <instance> --region <region>".
             It runs once and the value is kept in memory only.
  RECOVERY_USERNAME
             password: the account's username (default conformance)
  CHROME_PROFILE
             the browser's profile directory (default a fresh temporary one)

Run ONE plan at a time. The suite serves every plan's callback under its
`alias`, so starting a test in a plan that shares an alias interrupts the
running one, with "Stopping test due to alias conflict" in its log.
