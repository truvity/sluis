# This repository is public and its history cannot be unpublished — a
# rewrite changes the SHAs but not what was already fetched. So the rule
# ("mechanism only; particulars are caller inputs or org variables") is
# enforced mechanically rather than remembered.
#
# Vendored from truvity/ci-workflows (hack/leak-canary.sh), which is public
# for the same reason. Keep it in step with that copy.
#
# Every chart value, action input or documented example that names a
# cluster, an account, a hostname or a secret path is an INPUT with a
# neutral default; the consuming installation supplies the particulars
# from its own repository.
#
# Deltas from that copy, each with its reason. Every one MASKS a narrow
# shape on the matching lines and matches the pattern again, so a real
# particular on the same line as an allowed shape still fails:
#
#   - The account-id and ECR-host patterns skip AWS's own documented
#     placeholder accounts (111122223333, 444455556666), the neutral values
#     the docs, the tests and the action's examples use. Only those two.
#   - 'arn:aws' skips an ARN whose account field is one of those two
#     placeholders or a format verb (%s): sluisctl and the action COMPOSE
#     role ARNs from an audience the caller supplies. Any other ARN still
#     matches, including one with no account (an S3 bucket's).
#   - '/secrets/' skips '/var/run/secrets/', the root Kubernetes mounts a
#     pod's ServiceAccount token and projected volumes under. It is a path
#     inside the container, not an SSM parameter.
#   - The internal-hostname pattern skips the label key prefix earlier
#     releases wrote, in the two files that must spell it and nowhere
#     else: internal/kube/legacy_labels.go, which moves objects off it at
#     start, and CHANGELOG.md, whose rollback note moves them back. Any
#     other file naming it, or any other host in those two, still matches.
#
# Add a pattern here the first time something new turns out to be a
# particular. Never add an exception without one.

# Scan TRACKED FILES ONLY. The point of this canary is to stop particulars
