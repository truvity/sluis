# This repository is public and its history cannot be unpublished — a
# rewrite changes the SHAs but not what was already fetched. So the rule
# ("mechanism only; particulars are caller inputs or org variables") is
# enforced mechanically rather than remembered.
#
# Vendored from truvity/ci-workflows (hack/leak-canary.sh), which is public
# for the same reason. Keep it in step with that copy.
#
# Every chart value, action input or documented example that names a
# cluster, an account, a hostname or a secret path is an INPUT with a
# neutral default; the consuming installation supplies the particulars
# from its own repository.
#
# Deltas from that copy, each with its reason. Every one MASKS a narrow
# shape on the matching lines and matches the pattern again, so a real
# particular on the same line as an allowed shape still fails:
#
#   - The account-id and ECR-host patterns skip AWS's own documented
#     placeholder accounts (111122223333, 444455556666), the neutral values
#     the docs, the tests and the action's examples use. Only those two.
#   - 'arn:aws' skips an ARN whose account field is one of those two
#     placeholders or a format verb (%s): sluisctl and the action COMPOSE
#     role ARNs from an audience the caller supplies. Any other ARN still
#     matches, including one with no account (an S3 bucket's).
#   - '/secrets/' skips '/var/run/secrets/', the root Kubernetes mounts a
#     pod's ServiceAccount token and projected volumes under, and
#     '/etc/audit/secrets/', where the audit chart projects a Secret's keys.
#     Both are paths inside the container, not SSM parameters.
#   - 'arn:aws' also skips an ARN whose region and account fields are each
#     empty or a <placeholder>, the shape the audit documentation and Go
#     comments write ('arn:aws:iam::<account>:role/...', 's3:::<bucket>').
#     A real account id in the same ARN still matches.
#   - The internal-hostname pattern skips the label key prefix earlier
#     releases wrote, in the two files that must spell it and nowhere
#     else: internal/kube/legacy_labels.go, which moves objects off it at
#     start, and CHANGELOG.md, whose rollback note moves them back. Any
#     other file naming it, or any other host in those two, still matches.
#
#   - The internal-hostname pattern also skips 'schemas.truvity.com/audit/',
#     the legacy schema identifier base that audit's loader still accepts
#     (audit/docs/decisions/0015), in the audit tree only. It is a name that
#     was never served, kept for the compatibility of archived records.
#
# Estate-internal names (a pattern group added with the neutral-names
# change): the owner's rule is that this public tree names no estate, so
# the names are matched as words, case-insensitively, and the script itself
# is excluded as for every other pattern. 'kernel' is deliberately NOT a
# pattern: it names a cluster in the estate but is also the OS kernel in
# legitimate places, and this script has no context-specific patterns.
# 'hive' is word-bounded so archive/archived never match.
#
# Add a pattern here the first time something new turns out to be a
# particular. Never add an exception without one.

# The 12-digit patterns are anchored on word boundaries. Without them,
# `[0-9]{12}` also matches a 12-digit run that happens to fall inside a
# longer hex string -- and a nixpkgs commit SHA is exactly that. The
# devbox bump to 17de0b976395537756f30a3e78f2f06e5cec89ed contains
# `976395537756`, which failed this canary simultaneously in every repo
# that carries it, for a value that is neither a particular nor secret.
# `\b` keeps every real shape (bare, in an ARN, as an ECR host: each is
# bounded by a non-word character) and drops the hex-embedded ones.
