// Package policy is the schema both services load: seven tables that
// answer four questions and no others — who is in which internal group,
// what a group adds to a token, how long a token lives, and which client
// may be issued one — plus one OPTIONAL eighth, [Vocabulary], that answers
// none of the four itself and instead constrains what a name used to
// answer them is allowed to mean.
//
// Everything that shapes a token is derivable from these tables by
// reading them. That is the whole design goal, and it is why there is no
// expression language, no per-client rewriting and no precedence order:
// each of those makes a token's shape something you have to execute
// rather than read. The reference is docs/reference/sluis/policy.md.

//   - any Slack binding (a channel's [SlackChannel.From])
//   - this hub's own roles (groups whose [thing] segment is [ThingSelf] or
//     [ThingSluis] and whose role is [RoleOperator] or [RoleViewer], which the hub reads
//     directly from the token)
//   - catalogueGroups — see below
//
// A group referenced only by [Policy.Claims] or [Policy.Lifetimes] keys is
// still unconsumed: claims and lifetimes decorate a group and do not consume
// it; they add to a token only when a caller already holds the group for
// some other reason. Groups with the [rung] or [emp] prefix are never
// reported, because they are not grants and exist for other purposes.
//
// A GroupsOverride is judged by the SAME rule [Policy.ScopeGroups] applies
// to a live token, via [Policy.groupsOverrideKeeps]: `groups: all` keeps —
// and so consumes — every declared group, and `groups: [thing, ...]` keeps
// every declared group whose own thing or family one of those names,
// REGARDLESS OF SCOPE, because that is exactly how widely the override
// reaches at request time. This used to be this function's own KNOWN
// LIMITATION: docs/decisions/0006-groups-claim-scoped-per-audience.md gave a
// client a way to read groups beyond its Requires pairs without this lint
// ever learning of it, so a policy using that schema legitimately saw a
// warning for every group it reached only that way. Deciding it with the
// same function ScopeGroups itself calls means the two can never quietly
// disagree about what one override reaches.
//
// catalogueGroups are the groups a GitHub App catalogue's grants name —
// see internal/githubapp/catalogue.Grant.Group and
// internal/issuer/githubtoken.go's [DecideGitHubGrant], which is the thing
// that actually spends one: a caller presents a proof, the groups it
// resolves to are matched against each App's grants by this SAME string,
// and a match is what lets that caller ask GitHub for an installation
// token. A group declared for no other reason than to appear in one such
// grant is consumed exactly as one named in a client's Requires is — the
// catalogue is simply a file this package cannot read for itself: it is a
// deployment's own configuration, loaded by whichever process keeps a
// [GitHubApps] catalogue, and passing its grants' groups here is how that
// caller tells this lint about a consumer this package cannot see on its
// own. Nothing is assumed about the catalogue's shape here: a caller with
// no catalogue, or one that has not wired this yet, passes nothing, and
// every group a catalogue would otherwise explain keeps being reported —
// which is the false positive this parameter exists to close, not a new
// failure mode it introduces.
//
// This is a warning rather than an error because an installation may
// legitimately declare a group ahead of a client or resource that will use
// it, and a deployment's rollout should not wait for every reference to
// exist.
//
// A mapping wildcard key ([Policy.Vocabulary]) is judged by its EXPANSION:
// `*:k8s:admin` counts as consumed the moment any one of the concrete
// grants it maps to — `devel:k8s:admin`, `stage:k8s:admin`, and so on — is
// itself consumed by something, because that is the same grant reaching a
// caller through a shorter key. catalogueGroups is checked by the same
// rule as every other consumer: a grant naming the wildcard key's own
// concrete expansion counts, exactly as a client's Requires naming it
// would, because [DecideGitHubGrant] only ever compares a grant's Group
// against a caller's already-resolved, always concrete groups — a
// catalogue can no more grant a bare mapping wildcard to anyone than a
// caller can hold one.
