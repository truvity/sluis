// ClientDocuments admits clients that were never declared here.
//
// Every other client in this file is minted as code, and that is the
// right default: a row is reviewable, and its `requires` is where "who
// may obtain a token" is decided. It does not fit a client that is
// somebody's editor or a hosted assistant — software this installation
// does not deploy and cannot enumerate, arriving with the Model Context
// Protocol.
//
// Such a client identifies itself with an HTTPS URL that serves a
// document describing it (OAuth Client ID Metadata Document). The issuer
// fetches the document, validates it, and treats it as a public client.
// Nothing is registered and nothing accumulates.
//
// THE REASON THIS IS PROPORTIONATE, because it is the whole argument:
// registration is not the authorization decision here. Reach is decided
// by the groups a caller holds, and a client this issuer has never seen
// cannot widen them — it can only ask a person to consent to the reach
// that person already has. So the threat is not escalation. It is
// phishing: a hostile client persuading somebody to sign in to it and
// taking the token away. Which is why the guard below is an allow-list
// of ORIGINS rather than a refusal of unknown clients, and why
// [ClientDocuments.Requires] is mandatory rather than optional.

	// in at all, which is not a decision anybody would make on purpose.

	// installation that needs one document client interactive and another
	// agent declares one of them as a client row, and an origin admitted
	// with `session: agent` must serve only documents its vendor controls,
