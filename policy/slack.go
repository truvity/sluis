// Slack binds internal groups to Slack channels, in one or more
// workspaces. Like [Policy.GitHub] it grants nothing here and appears in
// no token: a controller reads it and makes each channel's membership
// match the people who hold the bound groups.
//
// It lives in this file for the reason GitHub's bindings do — a reader of
// the access model sees every channel's source without opening another
// file — and a channel is a consumer of a group exactly as a GitHub team
// or a client's `requires` is. Which accounts hold a group is a question
// only the directory answers, so nothing about a Slack account appears
// here; the only Slack-specific facts are the workspace's key and the channels
// bound in it. Which team the key stands for, which directory owns it and
// which domains its people use are not policy: sluis records them
// when the workspace is connected and reads them from the directory.
//
// The Slack controller reads these keys and acts on them: it creates or
// adopts each bound channel and keeps its members in step with the groups
// that are bound to it, in the workspaces it is told to act in.

// channel is exact: membership is made to match the bindings, removing
