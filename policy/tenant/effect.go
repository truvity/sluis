//     pattern of the ceiling (a rung's own group, `rung:<name>`, matches
//     when the ceiling lists the rung), and every matcher it gained must be
//     on an organisation, cluster or account the owner holds;
//   - a member a group gained must be in the owner's directories, unless
//     the base roster already holds that member somewhere: the people of
//     the installation reach a company's new group through the rungs, and
//     the pattern bounds where, while a fragment cannot name one;
//   - anything the fragment may not change is refused: a member or matcher
//     a group loses, a group that disappears, a lifetime that changes, the
//     default lifetime, a deferred grant, a binding of an organisation or
//     workspace the owner does not hold, the people registry.
//
// A company that joins a rung inherits the rung's cells, so what it reaches
// is bounded by the groups those cells derive and not by the names it
// wrote. A new rule in the derivation cannot widen a company either: it
// shows up as a change here. The check is conservative; a change it cannot
// tell is harmless is refused.
//
// A base with no scopes matrix has no roster, and an effect that cannot be
// seen is refused. CheckEffect does not read the fragment's rows; [Check]
// does, and [MergeAll] runs both. It assumes that no key of the fragment is
