// release computes and logs the answer (`groupsScoping: report`) and
// mints the token exactly as before; an `enforce` mode that actually
// narrows a token's `groups` claim ships later.
//
// audience is a client id, or the RFC 8707 resource a request named
// (see docs/reference/sluis/policy.md#resources--what-a-token-is-for) -- for a
// token exchange, the audience the exchange was GRANTED, never the id of
// the client presenting it.
//
// held is every internal group [Policy.Evaluate] returned in its
// Result.Groups -- after the vocabulary's inheritance closure, which
// Evaluate has already run. ScopeGroups does not repeat that walk; it
// only decides which of the names it is handed a token would keep.
//
// A group is kept when EITHER:
//
//   - its <scope>:<thing> pair matches one of the audience's `requires`
//     pairs, in ANY role. A client requiring `devel:grafana:viewer` keeps
//     a held `devel:grafana:editor` too, because the pair is what is
//     checked, never the role -- exactly the example
//     docs/decisions/0006-groups-claim-scoped-per-audience.md gives; or
//   - the audience's `groups` override asks for it: `all` keeps
//     everything held, and a list of thing names keeps every held group
//     of one of those things, in ANY scope, beyond whatever
//     requires-pair matching already kept.
//
// A held name that is not a concrete three-segment grant -- a `rung:` or
// an `emp:` name, neither of which is a role on a thing -- has no
// <scope>:<thing> pair to match, so requires-pair matching never keeps
// it. It is kept only when the override's thing list names it OUTRIGHT,
// by its own full name (`groups: [rung:sre]`), which is what "they're
// carried only if an override asks" means for a name with no thing to
// list. Nothing about EVALUATING them changes: a rung's lifetime, in
// particular, is read by [Policy.lifetimeOf] off the FULL held list
// [Policy.Evaluate] returns, before this function ever runs, so a `rung:`
// group this function drops from a token still shortens that token's
// life exactly as it does today. Scoping narrows what a token SAYS, never
// what the issuer computes from what a caller holds.
//
// A self-described client -- one admitted by URL through
// [Policy.ClientDocuments] rather than a row of its own -- IS gated, by
// `client_documents.requires`, which every such client shares; see
// [Policy.audienceScope]. Its pairs and its `groups` override, if it
// declares one, are read from there.
//
// An audience [Policy.audienceScope] cannot place at all -- not a
// declared client, not a declared resource, and not a URL
// [Policy.ClientDocuments] permits (including every audience when this
// installation admits no document client) -- has no requires pairs this
// function can read and no override it could have written, so every held
// grant is dropped. That is the plain reading of the decided rule: "the
// groups its client's or its resource's requires names" presupposes a
// gate, and a caller of this function that cannot find one has nothing to
// keep by. It is also the useful reading for report mode, whose whole
// purpose is to surface exactly this: an audience minting tokens today
// that this function cannot place under any gate is the signal that it
// needs one, before enforce mode could narrow anything for it correctly.

// of the two, both sorted, and both nil when held is empty.
