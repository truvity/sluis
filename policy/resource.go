// Resource is something a token may be minted FOR, as distinct from the
// client that asks for it.
//
// Every other audience in this file is a client's id, because until now
// the two were the same thing: a person signs in to Argo CD, and the
// token is for Argo CD. That holds wherever the application a person
// reaches and the software asking on their behalf are one.
//
// It stops holding the moment they are not. A Model Context Protocol
// client is somebody's editor; what it wants a token for is a service
// somewhere else. Minting `aud` as the client's id there says "this
// token is for the editor", which is not true and not useful: a service
// pinning `aud` to decide whether a token was meant for it would have to
// pin the name of every editor that might call.
//
// So a resource is declared, a client asks for it by name with the
// `resource` parameter (RFC 8707), and `aud` is the resource. The two
// gates then compose, which is the point: [Client.Requires] says who may
// use this client, and [Resource.Requires] says who may reach this
// service, and a caller has to satisfy both.
