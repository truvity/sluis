## Design notes relevant to a reviewer

- The service **holds directory credentials so that its consumers hold
  none**. Credentials — OAuth refresh tokens, service-account keys, the
  private keys of the GitHub Apps an owner created from the console,
  people's GitHub link tokens, the Slack Apps' client secrets and bot tokens — live only in Kubernetes Secrets in its
  own namespace; the ServiceAccount holds a namespaced Role, never a
  cluster-wide one. The console never returns secret material and the
  logs never print it. An operator may copy five of those Secrets, and the Slack state, out as
  a backup; the copy's custody is the operator's.
- The service is **read-only against the directory**: every scope it
  asks for is a read-only Admin SDK scope. A compromised service can
  enumerate accounts and groups; it cannot change them. Its write
  surfaces are **GitHub** and **Slack**. The GitHub controller invites,
  adds, promotes and removes members of the organisations listed in
  `githubRoster.actsIn`, with a key that lives only in its namespace. The
  Slack controller creates or adopts channels, invites people and, in
  `strict` private channels, removes them, in the workspaces listed in
  `slackRoster.actsIn`, with a bot token that lives only in its namespace (a
  Secret mounted read-only into the controller, whose ServiceAccount can
  update one report ConfigMap and read no Secret through the API). The
  console can also archive an ordinary Slack channel, only when an operator
  ticks *Also archive in Slack* when forgetting its record, and never a Slack
  Connect channel. Both controllers remove only on an answer the directory
  vouches for, never an owner, bot, app, guest or deactivated account, and
  never more than half of a channel, team or organisation without an
  operator's confirmation of exactly that set. The app configuration token an
  operator pastes to create a Slack App is used for one call and is never
  stored or logged. Every request- or Slack-derived value is routed through
  `logsafe` before it is logged, so a crafted value cannot forge a log record.
- The safety-critical output is the per-domain **authoritative** flag.
  Consumers that remove access act only on authoritative answers; a failed
  probe, a partial read, a stale snapshot or a domain conflict all read as
  "not authoritative", never as "gone".
- Every service here trusts **exactly two anchors** and never a third
  ([docs/design/trust.md](docs/explanation/trust.md)): the cluster (a
  ServiceAccount token checked by TokenReview, audience-bound,
  allow-listed) for workloads in the same cluster, and the issuer (its
  JWKS, an audience) for everything else. A workload calling the
  console's API presents its ServiceAccount token, verified against its
  cluster's published key set, so the service holds access to no
  cluster; a person presents the issuer's own session. NetworkPolicy
  gates both as the second layer, never the only one. Break-glass is the cluster anchor used as the floor: a
  ServiceAccount token a person mints with cluster RBAC, no stored
  credential in a cluster; outside one, a generated password held only
  as an Argon2id digest.
- The service **authenticates nobody.** Sign-in is always delegated to
  an identity provider; the service verifies the result and applies the
  policy. As a security token service it verifies proofs produced
  elsewhere — a corporate sign-in, a GitHub job's token, a cluster's
  ServiceAccount token — and holds no passwords, no users and no MFA. Of
  its own tokens, only the access token of a CLI sign-in at a public
  client declaring `sign_in_exchange` is a proof for exchange; an ID
  token is not (1.5.5).
- **A client may describe itself over HTTPS** (a Client ID Metadata
  Document, off unless `client_documents.origins` names a host): the
  fetch is an outbound request whose target — a URL — is steered by the
  `client_id` a caller presents, so it is an SSRF surface bounded by that
  allow-list. Every fetch is capped at 64 KiB and 5 seconds, follows no
  redirect, is cached for 10 minutes with no stale fallback on a failure,
  and a declared client in the policy always wins over a document one.
  See [docs/reference/policy.md](docs/reference/policy.md#clients-that-describe-themselves).
- The **audit trail** is kept by an audit installation connected as a
  plugin, which sluis reaches as its own workload (a projected
  service-account token) and holds no bucket or key for. Ordinary records
  never wait on it; a recovery sign-in does, and is refused when its record
  cannot be kept. The console's Audit page reads the installation with a
  short-lived token minted for the person signed in, never passed to the
  browser. The client
  address in a record is read from `X-Forwarded-For` only as far as
  `audit.forwardedForTrustedHops` says, so set it to the deployment's
  own proxies and no more.
