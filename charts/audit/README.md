# audit

One installation of the audit trail: the receiver, the writer, the jobs that
verify and prune what it writes, and the query service that reads it
back. The Audit page lives in the application's console and is not in here.

**This chart is instantiated, not deployed.** An installation belongs to one
application and runs in that application's namespace, rendered by the
application's own chart with this one as a dependency
([0011](../../docs/decisions/0053-one-installation-per-service-or-product.md)).
There is no central installation and no shape that puts the writer inside
the application. Start with [getting started on Kubernetes](../../docs/audit/getting-started/kubernetes.md);
the shapes are explained in [direct](../../docs/audit/explanation/direct-mode.md) and
[stream](../../docs/audit/explanation/stream-mode.md), and every value is in
[chart values](../../docs/audit/reference/chart-values.md).

## What it deploys

- **`audit-writer`**, a Deployment serving the sink and
  `RegistryService` — the application registers its catalogue with the same
  address it writes to. With `mode: direct` it is also the writer: it puts
  the objects and acknowledges once they are stored. With `mode: stream` it
  publishes to JetStream, and the same image runs again in consumer mode as
  the writer.
- **`audit migrate`**, a pre-install/pre-upgrade hook Job applying the schema
  before the parts roll, and granting each part's database role what the part
  needs (`migrate.config.writer`, `.observe`, `.reader`, `.purge`). It connects
  as the owner of the tables, which no part does. The parts refuse to start
  against a schema they do not know and never migrate themselves.
- **`audit-observe`** (`observe.enabled`), the indexer: a Deployment of its own
  that follows the archive by listing from a cursor per profile and tenant, and
  writes the index. It reads the archive and never writes it, under its own
  ServiceAccount and its own database role (`observe.config.database`), which
  must be neither the writer's, the query service's nor the owner's: the chart
  refuses them. It is the only writer of the index; the writer's role has none
  of it. `observe.config.wake` is an optional NATS subject or SQS queue of
  bucket notifications that only shortens the poll.
- **`audit-query`** (`query.enabled`), search, facets, get, export, tail and —
  given the keys — resolve, behind the grants in `query.grants`. Every read is
  recorded through the writer. It reads the index as **its own database
  role**, which must not own the tables (`query.config.database`).
- **`audit-notary`** (`jobs.notary.enabled`, off by default), an hourly CronJob in
  an image of its own that seals every closed hour into a signed chain
  ([0019](../../docs/decisions/0061-seals.md)). It signs, so it runs as an identity
  of its own that the chart refuses to be the writer's, with a P-384 key in KMS
  or OpenBAO.
- **Three CronJobs**: `audit verify` nightly (one job
  for the profiles it lists, or every profile; with `seals.roots` it checks the
  seals too), `audit purge` daily,
  `audit clock-sync` daily. Each runs `--config` against its own file and
  records what it did through the writer's own sink. `clock-sync` needs at
  least one reference clock (`jobs.clockSync.config.ntp`): every framework profile with a
  compliance obligation asks for a daily record of the offset, and its
  configuration is refused without one.

`mode` chooses between them. In `direct` the chart renders one Deployment that
serves the sink and writes the archive. With `writer.enabled: false` the write
path is not in this release (it runs elsewhere, typically the writer Lambda): no
writer, receiver, consumers or Service are rendered, and everything that records
(the query service, the notary and the other jobs) sends to the writer's queue
with `sink: {sqs: {queueUrl, region}}` under its own pod identity; the chart
refuses a sink that names the release's own front door
([AWS](../../docs/audit/how-to/aws-run-readers-in-kubernetes.md),
`examples/external-writer.yaml`). In `stream` it renders two: a receiver
that serves the sink and publishes, holding neither the bucket nor a key, and
`writer.consumers` writers that read the stream and put the objects. The
Service keeps its name and the receiver keeps the `writer` component label in
both, because it is the address records are written to and that should not move
when a deployment changes shape.

Four images, one per binary: `image.writer`, `image.query`, `image.notary`, `image.cli`. The
receiver serves `RegisterCatalogue`, so there is no fourth.

**Whose catalogue is whose.** The writer takes it from the caller's verified
service account, never from the document, and `workloadIdentity.workloads` is
the mapping: one entry per workload that may register, naming the source it
speaks for. A workload missing from it cannot register at all. An installation
that keeps an index and verifies callers must fill it in, and the chart refuses
to render when it is empty — with no mapping every registration would be
refused at run time instead.

## How it is configured

Each component has a `config:` block: the binary's own configuration file,
rendered as it stands into a ConfigMap `<fullname>-<component>-config` and
mounted at `/etc/audit/config.yaml`. The components are `writer`, `receiver`
(stream mode), `query`, `migrate` and `jobs.verify`,
`jobs.purge` and `jobs.clockSync`. The chart translates none of it: a key
under `config:` is the binary's key, and it is validated by
`values.schema.json`, which embeds the schemas in `schemas/config/`, and again
by the binary at start-up. The
[configuration reference](../../docs/audit/reference/configuration.md) lists every
key.

What is not configuration is the platform's, and each component has the same
three of those:

- `secretFiles`: a Secret's keys as files under `/etc/audit/secrets`, one for
  each name the config holds in a `...Secret` field (`passwordSecret`,
  `credentialsSecret`, `tokenSecret`); the config says
  `secrets: {source: file, root: /etc/audit/secrets}`, which the chart checks.
  A secret is never in `config:`. `secretEnv` (environment variables from a
  Secret's keys) is deprecated and belongs to version-1 configs, see the
  [v0.13 upgrade](../../docs/audit/how-to/upgrade/v0.13.md);
- `secretMounts`: a Secret mounted as a directory, for a key or a root a
  config names by path;
- `tokens`: a projected service-account token of an audience, a file `token`
  in the `mountPath`, for `tokenFile` and `jwtFile` to name.

Telemetry is the `OTEL_*` environment. `telemetry.otlp` (`endpoint`,
`protocol`, `extraEnv`) renders it on every pod when an endpoint is set and
renders nothing otherwise ([telemetry](../../docs/audit/reference/telemetry.md#the-chart-sets-the-environment)).
The documents a config names by path are
rendered from the chart's own values: `profiles` into
`/etc/audit/deployment.yaml`, `workloadIdentity` into
`/etc/audit/workloads.yaml`, `query.grants` into `/etc/audit/grants.yaml`,
`catalogues` into `/etc/audit/catalogues/`. `trust` mounts a CA bundle at
`/etc/audit/trust/<key>` and `keysVolume` the local key directory at
`/var/lib/audit/keys`.

## Publishing the query service

An installation needs a public name only when the application console that
calls its query service runs **outside the cluster** (the person's browser
reaches it, or the console is hosted elsewhere). When the console runs in
the cluster, leave `query.route` off: the console reaches the Service
`<fullname>-query` in-cluster and proxies the calls server-side. Where one
host fronts the application, `<app host>/audit` is the form to prefer;
`audit.example.com/<installation>` serves several installations from one name.

With `query.route.enabled` the chart renders an HTTPRoute to the query
Service, so that the deployer does not write one by hand:

```yaml
query:
  route:
    enabled: true
    parentRefs:                       # a Gateway or a ListenerSet, passed through
      - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
        kind: Gateway
        name: public
        namespace: gateway
        sectionName: https
    hostnames: [audit.example.com]
    pathPrefix: /myapp                # optional: the path is the installation
    annotations: {}
    securityPolicy: {}                # optional, see below
```

- `parentRefs` and `hostnames` are required, and so is `query.enabled`: the
  chart refuses to render without them. Write each parent's `group`, `kind`,
  `name`, `namespace` and `sectionName` out in full; the API server fills in
  what is left out, and a GitOps tool then shows a diff for ever. For the same
  reason the backend's `weight: 1` is written by the chart.
- With `pathPrefix` the route matches `PathPrefix /<prefix>/audit.v1.QueryService`
  and rewrites that to `/audit.v1.QueryService` (`URLRewrite`,
  `ReplacePrefixMatch`), because the query service knows nothing of a prefix.
  Without one the route matches `/audit.v1.QueryService` and rewrites nothing.
- Only the query service's Connect path (`/audit.v1.QueryService/...`) is
  routed, under the prefix when there is one (the prefix is rewritten away).
  `/healthz` and `/readyz`, which answer without a token, are not reachable
  through the route.
- `securityPolicy`, when set, renders an Envoy Gateway `SecurityPolicy`
  (`gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1`) whose `spec` is the value you give, with
  `targetRefs` set by the chart to this HTTPRoute. The chart refuses
  `targetRefs`, `targetRef` and `targetSelectors` in it, so the policy cannot
  attach to anything but this route. It is
  for a gateway that requires every route to carry one. Needs the Envoy
  Gateway CRDs; the chart does not check for them.
- `networkPolicy.queryIngressFrom` decides what may reach the query pods when
  `networkPolicy.enabled` is on, and the gateway's own pods are such a caller:
  **list the gateway's namespace there** (a `namespaceSelector` on
  `kubernetes.io/metadata.name`), or the route will answer 503 while the pods
  are healthy. The chart does not add it for you, because it cannot know where
  the gateway runs.

The route is transport only. The query service authenticates every call
itself, checking the token's issuer and audience against its grants;
NetworkPolicy and SecurityPolicy are defence in depth, not the access control.

## What the deployment brings

The chart takes references; it creates none of these.

| thing | value |
|---|---|
| **a bucket for each install preset the profiles use**, belonging to the environment: the attested preset's with Object Lock in compliance mode (S3 only), the others without a lock ([0014](../../docs/decisions/0056-lock-modes-and-store-tiers.md), [0068](../../docs/decisions/0068-storage-is-configured-per-preset.md)) | `presets.<operational\|standard\|attested>.bucket` |
| **only on an S3-compatible store that is not AWS**: its endpoint, whether its certificate covers a bucket subdomain, and the address, below `archive.stateRoot` in the state store, of the static keys if it has no pod identity | `presets.<name>.endpoint`, `.path_style`, `.credentials`, with `archive.stateRoot` in each process's config |
| **a prefix of its own within the bucket**, required wherever the bucket is shared: it is what keeps two applications' archives apart, and what each role's IAM is scoped to | `presets.<name>.prefix` |
| **on AWS S3, a KMS key alias** per preset, a name and never a key id or ARN | `presets.<name>.key_alias` (or `archive.kmsKey` in the writer's and notary's config for every preset that names none) |
| a writer role that may put objects with a legal hold on (`s3:PutObjectLegalHold`), read and lengthen their retention (`s3:GetObjectRetention`, `s3:PutObjectRetention`), and read `records/`, `catalogue/` and `holds/` | the writer's ServiceAccount annotation |
| a reference clock the clock-synchronisation job can reach | `jobs.clockSync.config.ntp` |
| **a database in the application's existing Postgres**, owned by a role of the migration's own and used by no part. It holds the index, its cursors and the rollups (rebuildable by following the archive again, so no backup) and the writer's dedupe table and registry | `migrate.config.database` and `passwordSecret`, with `migrate.secretFiles` |
| **a role for the writer**: the dedupe table, the registry and the key directory, and none of the index | `writer.config.database` and `passwordSecret`, with `secretFiles`; `migrate.config.writer` names the role |
| **a role for the indexer**: read and write on the index and its cursors | `observe.config.database` and `passwordSecret`, with `observe.secretFiles`; `migrate.config.observe` names the role |
| **a separate read-only role** for the query service: `usage` on the schema, `select` on the index's tables and nothing else. Tenant row-level security binds only a role that does not own the tables | `query.config.database` and `passwordSecret`, with `query.secretFiles`; `migrate.config.reader` names the role |
| a P-384 signing key the notary may use and the writer may not (KMS `ECC_NIST_P384`, or OpenBAO `ecdsa-p384`), and the thumbprint of its public half for every verifier to pin | `jobs.notary.config.signer`, `jobs.verify.config.seals.roots` |
| the JetStream stream, already created, with `mode: stream` | `writer.config.stream`, `receiver.config.stream` |
| **if the broker verifies who connects**: an auth callout that reviews a projected service-account token and maps this namespace to an account, accepting the audience the chart projects | `stream.nats.tokenFile` and a `tokens` entry of the broker's audience |
| the issuers callers sign in with, and who may read what | `query.grants` ([access](../../docs/audit/how-to/read-the-trail.md#access)) |
| an exports bucket with no Object Lock, if exports are wanted; on a store of its own if need be | `query.config.exports.bucket`, with its own `endpoint`, `pathStyle` and `credentialsSecret` |
| the cluster's service-account issuer, reachable over HTTPS from the pods | `workloadIdentity.issuers` |
| the images | `image.writer`, `image.query`, `image.observe`, `image.notary`, `image.cli` — one per binary, built by ko from `.goreleaser.yaml`; distroless, no shell |
| a role per component — writer, indexer, notary, query and verify — bound through its ServiceAccount's annotations. The receiver, purge and clock-sync have accounts and no roles; the chart refuses the receiver, the notary and the indexer, sharing the writer's | `serviceAccount`, `receiver.serviceAccount`, `observe.serviceAccount`, `query.serviceAccount`, `jobs.*.serviceAccount` |
| **only if the deployment chooses a key provider**: a Secret with the 32-byte root (`local`), or an OpenBAO transit engine with a JWT role per component ([what the engine needs](../../docs/audit/how-to/configure-openbao-keys.md#what-the-engine-needs)) | `keys.local.rootFile` with `secretMounts`, or `keys.provider: transit` with `keys.transit.openbao.login` and a `tokens` entry |
| a CA bundle, if OpenBAO or Postgres serve from a private chain (e.g. trust-manager's) | `trust.configMap` |
| a `ReadWriteMany` storage class, for more than one replica on `local` keys (transit needs none) | `keysVolume` |

## Keys are off

`keys.provider: none` is the default, which is no `keys` block: no key directory, no login to a secret
manager, no `identity/` prefix in the archive, and resolve refused as
`unimplemented`. A deployment instead declares
`externalIdentifiersAreOpaque`, which relaxes a profile's `external:
pseudonym` to `clear` and makes the writer refuse a record whose external
actor or subject carries something that looks like a direct identifier
([0013](../../docs/decisions/0055-no-pseudonymisation-keys-by-default.md)).

`local` and `transit` stay, for a deployment that must be able to
crypto-shred. An installation that runs neither must set
`externalIdentifiersAreOpaque`, or compose only profiles that keep nobody:
the writer refuses to start otherwise, naming the profile, rather than
writing whatever arrives into an archive nothing can edit.

## Extensions

Two projections of the same records, both off, both switched on per
installation, and neither adds anything to the request path:
`extensions.billing.enabled` adds rollups at index time and a monthly
statement CronJob; `extensions.quotas.enabled` adds a usage consumer, a
counter cache and an hourly reconciler, and needs `mode: stream`. Both toggles
exist and render nothing: what fills them is designed and not yet built, so
the toggles are here to keep a deployment's values from changing when it
lands. Billing refuses without a metering profile, and quotas without a
stream, because neither could work.

## Who may write

The receiver verifies every caller's projected service-account token against
the cluster's own OIDC issuer. The token's subject is the service account,
which the kubelet vouches for and the workload cannot choose, and the writer
stamps it on each record as the observer. The chart's own jobs and the query
service are given projected tokens (their `tokens`, audience `audit`) and
present them through `sink.tokenFile` the same way.

The application's pods mount a projected token with the same audience and
point `AUDIT_TOKEN_FILE` at it, or set the bearer themselves.
`anonymousWrites: true` in the writer's config turns verification off, for a
trial install only. The binary refuses to start with neither `workloads` nor
that key set.

The stream is reached the same way. With a `tokens` entry of the broker's
audience and `stream.nats.tokenFile` naming it, the receiver and the writers
present the token to the broker as their NATS token, read afresh on every
connect; the broker's auth callout, which is the deployment's, reviews it and
maps the namespace to an account. Without them, they connect with no
credentials, for a broker that verifies nobody
([stream](../../docs/audit/how-to/run-stream-mode.md)).

## What it refuses to render

Every configuration in `tests/invalid/audit/` is something the binaries
reject at start-up or, worse, accept and get quietly wrong, and
`testdata/refuse.sh` holds each refusal to its words; each file names the
reason on its first line. A `config:` that does not match its schema is
refused first, naming the path: a misspelt key, a missing `deployment`, a
password in a database URL, a value from before the file such as a top-level
`bucket`. What is left is what only the platform can see
(`templates/_checks.tpl`):

- `mode` is `direct` or `stream` and nothing else, and `profiles` is not
  empty;
- every profile is kept under a preset `presets` configures: the one its
  framework profiles need (or the stronger one the profile asks for with its own
  `preset`), refused otherwise naming both, as is a profile that asks for a
  weaker preset than its framework profiles need. Each preset needs a `bucket`;
  `key_alias` is an alias and never an ARN; `credentials` and `path_style` need
  an `endpoint`; and the attested preset is refused on an `endpoint`, because
  Object Lock is S3 only. `jobs.notary.enabled` is refused when no configured
  preset has a notary (the standard or the attested one), as is `renders: alerts`
  when none has alarms;
- `writer.config.replicas` is the number of writer pods the chart renders
  (`replicas` in direct mode, `writer.consumers` in stream mode), because the
  writer cannot count them itself, and more than one needs a `database` in
  `writer.config`, since deduplication in one process cannot absorb a
  redelivery that lands on another;
- `mode: stream` needs `receiver.config` with `mode: receiver`,
  `writer.config.stream` and a `database`;
- more than one writer pod with a `keysVolume` that is not ReadWriteMany:
  data keys are random rather than derived, so separate directories mean a
  different pseudonym for the same person on each replica. `query.keysVolume`
  needs the volume enabled and ReadWriteMany;
- `workloads` in the writer's config without `workloadIdentity.issuers`,
  issuers without `workloads`, an index with verified callers and no
  `workloadIdentity.workloads` (with no mapping every registration would be
  refused at run time), and a workload that names no issuer when more than one
  is trusted;
- the query service enabled with no `query.grants.issuers`, or with the
  writer's `database.url`: an owner bypasses the tenant policies;
- `query.route.enabled` without `query.enabled`, without `parentRefs` or
  without `hostnames`, and a `query.route.securityPolicy` that sets
  `targetRefs`, `targetRef` or `targetSelectors`;
- an extension enabled with no profile it can read: `extensions.billing`
  without a metering profile, `extensions.quotas` without `mode: stream`.

The binaries refuse the rest at start-up, naming the key: `stream.ackWait` not
longer than `roll.interval`, a bucket the attested preset names that has no
Object Lock (the writer checks the bucket it writes to), and OpenBAO configured with none or more than one way to sign in.

## Checking it

```
just chart          # lint, every refusal, golden renders
audit verify --profile <p> --last 24h --bucket <b>
```

The second needs read access to the archive and nothing else, and nothing
that has to be trusted. An archive written before the v1 layout is read by
nothing in v1 and stays verifiable with the previous release's CLI (v0.6.x).
