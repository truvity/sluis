{{/*
The refusals.

What a component's `config` says is checked twice before anything runs: by
values.schema.json, which embeds the schema each binary validates its file
against, and by the binary at start-up. What is left here is what only the
platform side can see: whether the shape the values ask the chart to render
agrees with what the configurations say. Each is a configuration the binaries
would accept and then do something silently wrong with — or a manifest they
would reject — and a chart that renders one moves the failure from
`helm install` to a CrashLoopBackOff somebody has to read logs to understand,
or to a trail that looks fine and is not.
