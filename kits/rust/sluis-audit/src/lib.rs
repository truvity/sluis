//! The audit emitter library (ADR 0028 "Four pieces"): it lives inside each emitting process,
//! holds no credential, and from one call builds one message, an OCSF 1.9.0 audit record as
//! RFC 8785 canonical JSON (ADR 0030 "The record format"), then hands it to the audit transport on
//! the emit socket.
//!
//! A person is never named in a record. The emitter asks key@ for `Mac` under the tenant's
//! pseudonym key before the record leaves the process (ADR 0029 "Pseudonyms"), so a [`Subject`]
//! becomes `p1.<YYYYMM>.<first 128 bits of the MAC>`.
//!
//! [`Emitter::emit`] hands the message over and returns; [`Emitter::emit_blocking`] returns only
//! when the transport says the message is durable (ADR 0029 "Sealing"). Delivery is at least once
//! and the writer removes a repeat by `metadata.uid`. The library keeps no queue and does not
//! retry: the spool driver behind the socket is the durable buffer, and a failure is returned to
//! the caller, who logs it.
//!
//! A best-effort fact that cannot be delivered ([`Emitter::emit`], or
//! [`Emitter::emit_blocking_best_effort`]) is lost, and the emitter counts it in memory, for the
//! tenant of the event. A record of that tenant carries the running total of the process as
//! `unmapped.sluis.lost` (`process`, `total`, `since`) until a record that carries the current
//! total has been delivered, so a repeat is harmless and a reader takes the highest total of a
//! process and never sums (ADR 0029 "Facts that are lost are counted"). The total is not a queue
//! and nothing is resent; a process that exits with an unreported total takes it with it. A call
//! that is dropped before it finishes (a caller's timeout) counts as a failure.
//! [`Emitter::emit_required`] is `emit` for a caller that fails its operation on an error: that
//! fact is not lost and is not counted.
//!
//! The Go package `kits/go/audit` produces the same bytes from the same input
//! (`kits/conformance/audit`).
