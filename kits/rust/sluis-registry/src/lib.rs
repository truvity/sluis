//! The enforcement tables that every process of sluis compiles in: the store's rules
//! (actor x kind x verb), key's rules (actor x scope x purpose x op), the call graph and the pinned uids.
//!
//! `generated.rs` is made by `tools/gen/registry` from `docs/architecture/actors.yaml`,
//! `kinds.yaml` and `keys.yaml`, so that nothing that enforces least privilege is written by hand
//! (ADR 0002, "Registries generate the enforcement"). Run `just registry-gen` after a registry
//! changes; `just registry-check` fails while the generated files are stale. This file is the
//! hand-written API over them. The Go package `kits/go/registry` has the same API and the same
//! data.
//!
//! Every lookup is by exact name and allocates nothing: an unknown actor, kind, purpose or verb is
//! denied, never an error.
