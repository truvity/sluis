//! `sluis config explain`: what each setting of a bootstrap file and a config set resolves to, and where it comes
//! from (REQ-OPS-023; cli.md "`sluis config check` and `explain`"; ADR 0005, "Configuration loading").
//!
//! It runs on the very set that [`super::offline::load_dir`] accepts, so only a set that store@ would load is
//! explained: an effective value exists only for a set that is in force. For each setting it names the storage class,
//! the layer that set it (`bootstrap`, `config` or `built-in`), the version of that layer (the `seq` of a document,
//! the release for a built-in) and the source (the document as the audit fact of a start names it,
//! `Kind:seq:sha384`). Settings that share all of these are one [`Group`], so the output grows with the settings and
//! not with the provenance repeated on each.
//!
//! # What it prints and never prints
//!
//! It fails closed. [`FIELDS`] is a closed table of the fields of each readable kind, each with a [`Treatment`]; a
//! field the table does not list is a digest (`Treatment::Digest`), so a new field or a new readable kind never prints
//! in clear until someone has decided that it may. The sweep test below fails when [`super::payload`] reads a key that
//! the table does not cover.
//!
//! - `Show`: the value, for a name, a number or an identifier that a reviewer reads in git. A document holds no
//!   credential by construction (bootstrap-file.md; ADR 0004, "Storage classes").
//! - `Url`: the value without its query and fragment, which carry tokens more often than anything else in a URL. The
//!   payload refuses user information in a URL, and a URL that holds some anyway is a digest.
//! - `Duration`: the value in the largest whole unit, as the bootstrap file's grammar writes it.
//! - `Reference`: the name of a credential in the secret source (`Upstream` and `InstallationClient`, `secret`), never
//!   the secret. It is marked, and this command opens no socket, so it cannot resolve one.
//! - `Pin`: a public key, as the SHA-384 of its bytes, the way a publisher key is its pin.
//! - `Digest`: the SHA-384 of the value's bytes.
//!
//! Whatever the treatment, a value longer than [`SHOWN_MAX`] bytes, or with a control character or an invisible
//! format character (bidirectional controls, zero-width characters, line and paragraph separators), is a digest: a
//! line stays a line, and a document cannot write an escape sequence or reorder the text on a terminal. A refusal names
//! a path and a rule, never a value, as `sluis config check` does.
