//! What `exporter` reads and writes in store@.
//!
//! - **Reads, linearizable.** [`Source::read`] lists `SigningRing` and `KeyRevocation` asking for a linearizable read
//!   (`ListRequest.consistency`), after the change that woke `exporter`. A revocation decides whether a key is in the
//!   document, so a listing from a leader that no longer leads, which might miss a revocation acknowledged before it,
//!   is not good enough. It lists, and does not `Get`: a ring that does not exist yet is the normal state before
//!   `signer` has written it, and a `Get` of an absent item is a refusal that store@ audits (REQ-AUDIT-180).
//! - **Writes.** [`Reports`] sets the temp kind `ExportReport` and [`Cursors`] the temp kind `ExportCursor`, both with
//!   `apply`: the writer is the only one, and the item is replaced as a whole.
