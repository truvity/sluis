//! The loop and the command line of `exporter`: `serve`, `check`, `version` (cli.md).
//!
//! `exporter` serves no socket. It follows `SigningRing` and `KeyRevocation` in two tasks (the watch helper of the
//! store client, from the resume point in `ExportCursor`) and a **dispatcher** turns what they say into one nudge to a
//! **worker for each destination**. A worker reads both kinds linearizably, for itself, and publishes its destination's
//! documents ([`crate::publish`]). One task for each destination keeps a destination that hangs from delaying a
//! revocation reaching a healthy one: each reads what is true when it wakes, and each has its own budget of 60 seconds
//! counted from the moment the change *arrived* at the dispatcher (REQ-EXPORT-028), not from the moment a busy loop got
//! to it. Events are coalesced: any number of them while a worker is busy are one more round. The events say *when*,
//! never *what*: a missed or repeated event cannot make the document wrong, only late, and the daily reconcile bounds
//! how late.
//!
//! - **Start.** Write the manifest (what is configured, for `signer`), remove the reports of what is not configured any
//!   more, then reconcile at once: read, compare with the destination, write what differs, purge, read back, report.
//! - **A change.** The same, as soon as the event arrives.
//! - **Watch.** The helper's positions are used as it gives them: a point goes to `ExportCursor` as the helper delivered
//!   it, and the start from it is the helper's `from`. A `Resync` *replaces* the held point (a restore can take the log
//!   back), a change only moves it forward. A point is the pair of the epoch of the log and the sequence in it, saved whole in `ExportCursor`; a cursor without an epoch is no point and the kind is listed again. A point the store no longer holds
//!   is a `Resync` and a full read, so a stale cursor costs a reconcile and never a skipped change. The document never
//!   comes from the watch's state, only from the linearizable listings read after it, so a watch that is behind can
//!   delay a publication and cannot make one wrong. The cursor is saved only while both follows are confirmed.
//! - **A watch that breaks.** A change might go unseen: the documents are reported `unverified` (until the report is
//!   stored), and the watch reconnects by itself. Each kind is confirmed again by its own first change, resync or
//!   bookmark; the other kind's events say nothing about it.
//! - **A kid in an event.** A revocation event names the kid. If the listings cannot be read, that kid is still taken out
//!   of the last good document (removal is monotone), and nothing else is changed.
//! - **A step that fails.** Tried again every `retry` until it passes; the report says `purge-pending` or `unverified`.
//! - **Once a day.** A full reconcile, which also refreshes the reports so that none expires while `exporter` runs.
//! - **Stop.** A stop is not held up by a call that hangs: every worker is cancelled, and a document is only ever
//!   replaced whole by the driver.
