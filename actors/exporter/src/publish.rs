//! The publication of one document (ADR 0009, "The order and the time"): after a change, in this order,
//!
//! 1. **write** the new document to the destination, whole (not at all when the destination already holds the same
//!    bytes with the same headers);
//! 2. **purge** its public address, so that the edge does not fill again with the old document;
//! 3. **read back** the public address the way a verifier does: it must answer 200 with the digest written;
//! 4. **report** by setting the temp kind `ExportReport` (REQ-EXPORT-021, REQ-EXPORT-022).
//!
//! A step that fails is tried again with a backoff until the budget of 60 seconds from the moment the change arrived
//! (REQ-EXPORT-028) is spent; past it the state is `purge-pending` (the document is written, the public address does
//! not show it yet) or `unverified` (the write itself failed), and the caller tries again. The state is `published` only
//! when the purge was accepted (or there is no edge to purge) **and** the read back then returned the written digest: a
//! read back after a purge that failed proves nothing about the other copies of the edge. It is `written` when the
//! destination has no public address to read back from.
//!
//! When the key set cannot be built because a kind cannot be read, the published object is left as it is and the report
//! says `unverified` (REQ-EXPORT-024). The one change made then is a **removal**: a `kid` that a `KeyRevocation` event
//! has just named is taken out of the last good document, because removal is monotone (no revocation can put a key
//! back), so it needs nothing that cannot be read. The state stays `unverified`, as the rest of the list is unknown.
//!
//! `unverified` and `purge-pending` are alarms: an error line that repeats every `alert_every` while they last (a
//! revoked key may still be published, and a log line that was written once at the start of a long outage is read by no
//! one), with the number of documents in that state, and one audit fact for each transition into and out of it.
