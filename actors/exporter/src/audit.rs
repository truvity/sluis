//! What `exporter` tells the audit log (ADR 0028 "Four pieces"; ADR 0030 "The class mapping").
//!
//! - `exporter.start`: the process began, with how many destinations and documents it publishes and how many documents
//!   the check refused (6003 API Activity / 99 Start).
//! - `exporter.write`: a document was written to a destination (REQ-EXPORT-017): the destination, the document, the
//!   address, the digest, whether it replaced a document and the number of kids a key set lists (3004 Entity Management /
//!   3 Update: one activity, so that the action table of ADR 0030 has one row for it). The facts of a public document are public; a count and a digest are all a record carries, never a
//!   joined list (a record's string holds 1024 bytes, and a ring may grow).
//! - `exporter.unverified`: a document went into the state `unverified` (exporter cannot tell whether the published object
//!   is right: a kind cannot be read, a watch broke, the destination takes no write) or came out of it. One fact for each
//!   transition, never for each retry or each repeat of the alarm (6003 API Activity / 99 Unverified; Failure
//!   with the closed reason in `status_code` on the way in, Success on the way out).
//! - `exporter.refused`: the check refused a document, with the closed reason (6003 API Activity / 99 Refuse). It is
//!   written once, at the start; the next start tries again (ADR 0009, "Refusals": not a retry loop).
//!
//! An idle `exporter` writes none of them: a reconcile that finds the document at the destination writes nothing.
//! Every fact is best effort (`emit`): the write it describes has happened, and a fact that cannot be delivered is
//! counted by the emitter for the next record (ADR 0029, "Facts that are lost are counted"). None fails an operation,
//! so `emit_required` is not used: a publication that waited for the spool could leave a revoked key published.
