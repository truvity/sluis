//! The key set: the kind `SigningRing`, one item `default` per boundary (PLAN.md D-17), that
//! `signer` writes and `entry` and exporter@ read (kinds.yaml).
//!
//! # Nodes and keys
//!
//! Every board has a token-signing key of its own in its card, and the boards share one ring, so the
//! ring holds one `active` key per node (ADR 0006 "The token-signing key": the key set carries every
//! active token key). Each key names its node, and a `signer` changes the keys of its own node
//! only: it never promotes, retires or reactivates another node's key. A node that rotates its key
//! therefore cannot make the other boards' keys stop, and two boards never undo each other.
//!
//! # The states of a key
//!
//! A key moves one way, `pre-published`, then `active`, then `retiring`, then it is dropped
//! (ADR 0006 "Rotation": the new key first, the old one after; ADR 0017 "Issuers"). A retiring
//! key never signs again:
//!
//! - **`pre-published`**: in the key set, not signing. Every cache between sluis and a verifier learns
//!   the key before the first token is signed with it. The lead time, [`Timing::prepublish`], is
//!   derived from the cache budget that sluis publishes (ADR 0006 "Rotation"): the key set's
//!   `max-age` of 300 s, the edge cache's time to live of at most as much, 10 minutes for a
//!   verifier's throttled refetch on an unknown `kid` (OpenID Connect Core section 10.1.1) and
//!   5 minutes of clock skew, 25 minutes, rounded up to 30. A verifier that keeps the set longer than
//!   `max-age` and does not refetch on an unknown `kid` is broken; v1 published a key for 12 hours
//!   because of one, and v2 detects such a verifier instead. A key becomes `active` after the lead time.
//! - **`active`**: the key that signs. `signer` signs only when the key key@ signs with is `active`.
//! - **`retiring`**: stopped signing, still in the key set until every token it signed has expired:
//!   the longest token lifetime plus the clock skew (REQ-KEYS-007). Any instance then drops it.
//!
//! Where a destination with a public address publishes the static key set, the lead time does not count from the write
//! to the ring but from the moment `exporter@` read the key back from the public address, and a key is not active
//! before it did (see "The static key set").
//!
//! A node's first key is `active` at once while the ring is young: when no key of the ring is older
//! than [`Timing::bootstrap`]. The boards of a first deploy start within minutes of each other, no
//! verifier has seen a token yet, and holding every board's first token back for the window would
//! stop the installation from starting. A node that joins later, or a key that replaces another,
//! is published for the full window first.
//!
//! A key also signs at once when the issuer has no other key that signs: no `active` key of the ring
//! that `KeyRevocation` does not list (see "A replacement for a revoked key"). Waiting would stop
//! every sign-in for the whole lead time, and there is no cached key for a verifier to rely on.
//!
//! # The static key set
//!
//! `exporter@` publishes the key set to a destination and reports what a verifier would see in the temp kind
//! `ExportReport` (ADR 0009, "The order and the time"). `signer` reads the reports of the key sets ([`Publication`]):
//! when a destination with a public address reports one, a key becomes active only after the report of every such
//! destination has the state `published`, lists the kid and has a read back at most 26 hours old (REQ-KEYS-116), the
//! lead time counts from that read back (REQ-KEYS-085), and a replacement for the last key that signs waits for the
//! read back and for nothing more (REQ-KEYS-089). A report that is `unverified`, `purge-pending`, without the kid or
//! too old keeps the key pre-published. A destination with no public address reports `written` and is not counted; with
//! none counted the lead time counts from the write, as it did before `exporter@` existed. A report that expires (seven
//! days without a publication) is also not counted: closing that gap needs `signer` to know which destinations should
//! report, which it cannot read yet (`ExportDestination` has no reader but `exporter@`).
//!
//! # A revoked key
//!
//! `revoked` is a fourth state, and a key is in it when `KeyRevocation` lists its kid (ADR 0041, "The
//! tighten-only record"): the item is the state, so `signer` writes nothing for it. A revoked key is never
//! added, promoted or signed with here (REQ-KEYS-106), and it is not in the key set that `signer`
//! answers with (REQ-KEYS-107). `signer` reads `KeyRevocation` at every call that needs it, and a
//! `KeyRevocation` that cannot be read refuses the call.
//!
//! # A replacement for a revoked key
//!
//! A replacement signs soon, not after the lead time, when the issuer has no live key that signs (ADR
//! 0041, "The replacement", REQ-KEYS-089). The issuer is the boundary, so the keys of every node
//! count: while any node still has a key that signs and that `KeyRevocation` does not list, verifiers
//! know it and see no unfamiliar `kid`, and a replacement is published for the full window like any
//! other new key. A key signs when it is `active`; one in a state this code does not know counts as
//! possibly signing (a rolling upgrade or downgrade must not skip the window), and only `retiring`
//! and `pre-published` keys, and revoked ones, count as not signing. So a normal rotation (the old key
//! is `active`) and a revoked spare never skip the window; in practice the shortcut is the case where
//! every `active` key is revoked. A revoked key itself never gets the shortcut (REQ-KEYS-106). The
//! change is an audit fact with the reason [`NO_ACTIVE_KEY`].
//!
//! What holds when the shortcut is taken: the new key is written to the ring, which `signer` and
//! `entry` build `/jwks` from, before `signer` answers for it, but `entry` keeps its built key set for
//! [`KEY_SET_CACHE`] (`entry` is separate and cannot be told to rebuild). So when the ring holds a
//! revoked entry, `signer` signs with an `active` key only from [`KEY_SET_HOLD`] (that time and a
//! second of margin) after the key joined the ring, and refuses the call as "not yet" until then. The
//! hold is read from the ring (`added_at`), so a restart does not lose it. After the hold, a key set
//! that `entry` serves lists the new key. A relying party may still hold a copy of `/jwks` from before
//! for the key set's `max-age` (300 s) plus the edge copy, which `exporter@` is to purge (REQ-KEYS-088;
//! not built): it must fetch the key set again on an unfamiliar `kid` (OpenID Connect Core 1.0,
//! section 10.1.1), and one that does not is broken, not accommodated (ADR 0041).
//!
//! A revoked key stays in the ring in the state it had, and every reader filters it by
//! `KeyRevocation` (`without_revoked`); nothing removes it yet (a garbage-collection follow-up).
//!
//! # How it is written
//!
//! The ring is created once (`create`: it fails if another instance did it first) and every later
//! change is an `update` at the version that was read, so two instances of `signer` never overwrite
//! each other: the one that loses re-reads and plans again. Each change is an audit fact.
