// Receiver is the front door of an installation that keeps its records on a
// stream: it stamps each record with the caller it verified and hands the batch
// to the next hop, which publishes it.
//
// Stamping has to happen here. The consumer on the other side of a stream has
// no caller to verify — it is reading messages, not serving a request — so a
// record that reached the stream unstamped would be written with no observer at
// all, and the trail would not say who reported what. The writer on the far
// side keeps a stamp that verifies rather than replacing it, because it can
// only be reading its own installation's stream.
//
// It is the same reasoning as everywhere else here: a reporter never says who
// it is. The identity comes from the token the authenticator checked, and the
// application cannot choose it.
