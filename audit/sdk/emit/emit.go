// Package emit is what an application imports to record what it did.
//
// An emitter fills what only it knows, holds the record to the catalogue that
// describes it, and hands it to a sink under the delivery the catalogue
// declares for that action. It does not decide what a record means, where it is
// stored or how long it is kept: those belong to the catalogue, the writer and
// the profile.
//
// The one thing an emitter does decide is whether the caller waits. An action
// declared block does not complete until its record is durable, which is what
// makes a privileged or billable action fail rather than go unrecorded.
