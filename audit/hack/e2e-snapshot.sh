# Build this repository's images and package its chart EXACTLY the way a
# release does: GoReleaser builds and pushes every image through ko, then
# helmctl reads what it pushed and bakes the digests into the chart — see
# .goreleaser.yaml's own header and release.yaml, which packages the same
# chart the same way for a real tag.
#
# What is different here, and only here:
#
#   - the destination is the kind box's own registry, not ghcr.io, and no
#     GitHub release is cut;
#   - every image is built for ONE architecture, the box's node's own,
#     rather than every architecture a release always carries — a second
#     one would only be built and discarded. That narrowing is produced by
#     hack/goreleaser-snapshot-config from THIS file, never a second
#     release configuration kept beside it (ported from truvity/policy,
#     which built this the same way for its own kind tier).
#
# NEVER --snapshot: GoReleaser's snapshot mode also stops every image
# being pushed, which is exactly the one thing this needs. `--skip=validate`
# is what makes a commit that is not a tag releasable instead.
