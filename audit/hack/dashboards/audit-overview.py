"""The audit overview dashboard, generated.

Written as code so that units, thresholds and descriptions are decisions made
once. `python3 hack/dashboards/audit-overview.py > charts/audit/dashboards/audit-overview.json`
regenerates it; `just telemetry` fails when the committed file differs.

It holds to the contract of truvity/observability's docs/dashboards.md, which
its `dashboardlint` enforces: a `datasource` variable that every panel uses, a
`cluster` variable chained off it and populated by label_values(), a
`namespace` variable chained off `cluster`, `$cluster` in the title, and
`$cluster` in every query.

Series are the ones the writer, the receiver, the indexer and the emitters publish over
OTLP, as the metrics gateway names them (dots to underscores, `_total` on
counters, the unit as a suffix). Only the cluster, namespace and tier become
labels from the resource, so every dimension used below (transport,
durability, profile, delivery) is a metric attribute. Nothing is labelled by
tenant: a tenant is unbounded, and a label that grows with customers is a
series count that grows with them.
