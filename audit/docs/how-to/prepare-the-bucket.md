# Prepare the bucket

## Purpose

Have a bucket, on the right tier, with a prefix for this installation, that the
writer, the indexer, the query service and the verify job can use.

## Preconditions

- Which tier the profiles need ([which profiles to compose](../explanation/which-profiles-to-compose.md)).
- An environment that owns the bucket: one bucket per environment, with Object
  Lock, versioning, replication and a deny-delete policy configured once, and one
  prefix per application, `audit/<application>/`
  ([0011](../decisions/0011-one-installation-per-service-or-product.md)).

## Before you start

- **Object Lock can only be turned on when a bucket is created** (or later, one
  way, on a versioned bucket on AWS). A bucket made without it cannot be a
  `record` tier bucket by editing; see [AWS turn on the lock](aws-turn-on-object-lock.md).
- **The writer refuses to start when a composed profile demands a stricter lock
  than the deployment writes with**, naming the profile and both modes. The first
  rollout is where that shows.
- **`prefix: ""` puts an installation at the bucket's root.** That is for a bucket
  with exactly one installation in it and nothing else, and it forecloses a second.
  A prefix is chosen when an installation is created and not changed afterwards:
  moving it moves every key.
- **`schema/` is easy to miss.** The writer reads it back on every start; a policy
  that lets it put and not get produces a writer that writes one object, takes a
  403 and dies in a loop, which reads as a broken archive rather than a missing verb.
- **Static S3 credentials are a secret**, named by `credentialsSecret` and found
  through the `secrets` block; they are never an environment variable the config
  names in version 2 ([configuration](../reference/configuration.md#secrets)).
- **Do not set a default retention longer than the shortest profile.** The writer
  sets each object's own.

## Steps

### Choose the tier

The bucket is on one of two tiers
([0014](../decisions/0014-lock-modes-and-store-tiers.md)), and which one is the
profiles' decision, not the operator's:

| tier | the preset | the store must answer | enough for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **record** | `attested` (compliance Object Lock; `governance` only for the trial of the lock) | `PutObject` with the Object Lock headers, `PutObjectRetention`, `PutObjectLegalHold`, `GetObject`, `HeadObject`, `ListObjectsV2`, presigned `GetObject` | every profile |
| **no lock** | `operational` or `standard` | `PutObject`, `GetObject`, `HeadObject`, `ListObjectsV2`, presigned `GetObject` | profiles composed only from framework profiles that demand no lock: `security`, `history`, `billing-nl` |

### Create the bucket

On the record tier:

```sh
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket example-audit \
  --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=eu-example-1 \
  --object-lock-enabled-for-bucket
```

On the no-lock tier, the same without `--object-lock-enabled-for-bucket`: it is the
bucket of an `operational` or `standard` preset in the deployment document.

The bucket needs:


- Versioning enabled. Object Lock enabled at creation with a **default
  retention in compliance mode** equal to the shortest profile's
  retention; the writer sets longer per object.
- SSE-KMS with a customer-managed key whose policy allows the writer to
  encrypt and the query service and the verify role to decrypt,
  and nobody to schedule deletion of the key without a break-glass role.
- Public access blocked. Bucket policy denies `s3:DeleteObject`,
  `s3:DeleteObjectVersion`, `s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration` changes
  that shorten, and `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention` to everyone; denies
  `s3:PutObjectLegalHold` removal except to the break-glass role with MFA.
- Server access logging or data-event trail enabled on the bucket, so
  direct reads are logged even when they bypass the query service.
- Cross-region replication to a bucket in another region and account with
  Object Lock, with replication of retention metadata.

None of that is per installation. An application arriving in the environment
gets a prefix and its own roles, and changes nothing about the bucket.

Expected: `aws s3api get-object-lock-configuration` (record tier) shows `Enabled`.
Verify: a put of a test object under `audit/<application>/` succeeds and a delete
is refused. Roll back: an empty bucket can be deleted; one with versions under
compliance retention cannot.

### Give the installation a prefix

Each installation is told its prefix once per preset, as `prefix` of the preset in the
deployment document its components read:

```yaml
presets:
  standard: {bucket: audit-eu-example-1, region: eu-example-1, prefix: audit/<application>/}
```

Under that prefix the layout is the same for every installation, which is what
lets two applications on different versions of this component share one bucket:
the archive's layout is the contract between them, not the code. Lifecycle rules
filter on `<prefix>/records/<profile>/`, one rule per profile per application: a
bucket-wide rule would apply the shortest profile's transition to every
application in it.

Then scope each role's IAM under the prefix
([archive prefixes and IAM](../reference/archive-prefixes-and-iam.md)). Verify:
the writer starts and `audit verify` over the first hour reports the objects.
Roll back: remove the prefix's roles; the prefix itself stays (the archive is
append-only).

### The attested tier

The same archive, the same keys under the same prefix — on a store that holds no lock. Either the store has no Object Lock API,
which is most S3-compatible stores, or the deployment composes only profiles
that demand none and chooses not to lock. The preset is not `attested` (the interactive commands' `--lock-mode none`); the writer sends no lock header on
any put, and answers a retention extension or a legal hold with
`store.ErrNotLockable`: the extension is recorded in the trail as not made,
and `audit hold place` is refused and records the attempt.

What the deployment supplies in place of the lock:

- **Seals under a managed key.** Without the lock, only a seal made with a key
  the operator cannot re-sign with proves the operator did not choose what the
  archive holds. The notary writes them ([0019](../decisions/0019-seals.md)); run
  it on this tier. The per-object `sha256` and per-record hashes that
  `audit verify` checks are the lower layer.
- **No delete permission on any component**, exactly as on the record tier,
  and versioning on where the store offers it.
- **A bucket-level no-delete rule where the store has one.** Several stores
  let an administrator forbid deletes on a bucket or a prefix by a rule the
  same administrator can remove. That is governance-shaped protection, worth
  having and not to be mistaken for compliance mode; record in the
  deployment's own runbook that it is set.
- **Retention as a lifecycle rule** rather than a lock: the store expires
  objects when the rule says, and nothing stops the rule being shortened. A
  profile that cannot accept that demands the lock, and says so.

`audit verify --deployment <file>` then reports each object as `unlocked`
rather than pretending to have checked a lock; under a profile that demands
one, an object with no lock is `INVALID`.


### S3-compatible stores

Any store that speaks the S3 API takes the `operational` or `standard` preset, and the
`attested` one only if it is AWS S3 (the lock is an AWS guarantee). Three things differ from
AWS, and each is a key of the preset in the deployment document (`endpoint`, `path_style`,
`credentials`):

```yaml
presets:
  operational:
    bucket: audit-example
    region: auto
    endpoint: https://s3.example.test
    path_style: true
    credentials: internal/audit/main      # below the process's archive.stateRoot
```

- **The endpoint.** `endpoint`. Unset is the SDK's own resolution for the region, which is AWS.
- **Path-style addressing**, when the store's certificate does not cover a bucket subdomain:
  `path_style` sends `endpoint/bucket/key` rather than `bucket.endpoint/key`.
- **Static credentials**, when the store has no pod identity: `credentials` is the address, in
  the installation's state store below `archive.stateRoot`, of a JSON object
  `{accessKeyID, secretAccessKey}`, read with the process's own identity. No secret is in a
  file. Unset, the SDK's ambient credentials are used, which is what a workload identity provides.
- **A private CA.** `archive.ca` is the path to a bundle trusted for the endpoint, mounted by
  the platform (the chart's `trust` puts one at `/etc/audit/trust/<key>`).

With an endpoint set, the SDK's default CRC32 request checksum — which AWS
answers and other stores may refuse — is sent only where an operation
requires one. The SHA-256 the archive names on every put is still sent, and
still stored as the object's checksum where the store keeps one.

One region-shaped trap: a store that serves one region and does not answer
a bucket-location lookup wants `region` set to whatever it documents
(often `auto`), so that the SDK skips the lookup. Set it as
`bucket.region`.

Where the store's documentation names an S3 feature it does not implement
— conditional writes (`If-None-Match`), `ListObjectsV2` continuation, SSE-KMS
with a customer key — check before choosing it: the writer relies on the
first two, and `archive.kmsKey` on the third.


## Afterwards

- Break-glass reads: auditors get a read-only role scoped to one installation's
  `records/` and `catalogue/`; their reads appear in the bucket's access log and,
  through the query service, as `audit.get` and `audit.search` records.
- Keep the exports in a **separate bucket with no Object Lock** and a lifecycle
  rule that expires `export/`: an export is a copy meant to be collected and
  cleared, and the archive's policy denies every delete.
