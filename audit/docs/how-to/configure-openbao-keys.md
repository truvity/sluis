# Configure pseudonymisation keys in OpenBAO

## Purpose

Set up an OpenBAO (or Vault) transit engine, the JWT roles and the policies so that the `transit` key provider can pseudonymise and crypto-shred, and so that no replica can mint a key another cannot see.

## Preconditions

- A deployment that **must be able to crypto-shred** and has chosen `transit` for it. Pseudonymisation keys are off by default (`keys.provider: none`) and nothing here applies otherwise ([0013](../decisions/0013-no-pseudonymisation-keys-by-default.md), [key custody](../explanation/key-custody.md)).
- An OpenBAO namespace (or Vault) you administer, and the cluster's service-account issuer reachable by it.

## Before you start

- **A transit key that will sign seals is a different key** and not on this page ([signing key](../explanation/key-custody.md#signing-key)).
- **Keys are never rotated**, and every call is pinned to the key's first version, so a rotation by somebody else changes nothing ([never rotated](../explanation/key-custody.md#never-rotated)).
- **Give each component a role of its own.** Each is a separate privilege, and one identity holding two is what the separation exists to prevent.
- **The writer creates a key the first time it sees a tenant for a purpose.** Creating is idempotent in the engine. A purpose is a profile's name and, under this provider, holds letters, digits, `_` and `-`, no dot.

## Steps

Pseudonymisation keys are off by default: `keys.provider: none`, and nothing
on this page applies
([0013](../decisions/0013-no-pseudonymisation-keys-by-default.md),
[key custody](../explanation/key-custody.md)). Read on only for a deployment that must be
able to crypto-shred and has chosen `transit` to do it with. A transit key
that will sign seals is a different key
([signing key](../explanation/key-custody.md#signing-key)); nothing in the chart uses one
today.

The `transit` key provider keeps every tenant's key for every purpose in an
OpenBAO (or Vault) transit engine. It is the provider for a deployment of more
than one writer:

- **The key material never leaves the engine.** A pseudonym is the engine's
  HMAC of the identifier; a sealed identifier (for [resolve](../reference/api.md#resolve))
  is the engine's encryption of it.
- **Every replica asks the same engine**, so two writers cannot mint different
  keys for one tenant. `local` needs a `ReadWriteMany` directory for that.
- **There is no directory to lose.** Losing a `local` key directory re-keys
  every tenant without a word.

The cost is one round trip to the engine for each pseudonym.

### Keys

One transit key per purpose and tenant, named `<prefix>.<purpose>.<tenant>`
(`audit.security.acme` with the default prefix). The writer creates a key the
first time it sees a tenant for a purpose. Creating is idempotent in the
engine, so replicas meeting a new tenant at once share one key.

A purpose is a profile's name. Under this provider it may hold letters,
digits, `_` and `-`, and no dot, so that no two (purpose, tenant) pairs can
name the same key.

Every call is pinned to the key's **first version**. Keys are never rotated
(rotating would break linkability for one person across time), and pinning
means a rotation by somebody else changes nothing.

### What the engine needs

In the namespace the keys live in (in an estate with a namespace per
environment, the environment's):

- a **transit** engine, at `openbao.mount` (`transit`, a key of the `openbao`
  block of the configuration);
- a **JWT auth mount** that takes this cluster's service-account tokens, e.g.
  `jwt-devel`, with one **role per component**. Each role binds the
  component's service account as the subject and `openbao` as the audience,
  and names the component's policy:

| component | service account (chart default) | where its role is set | policy |
|---|---|---|---|
| writer | `<release>` | `writer.config.keys.transit.openbao.login.role` | writer |
| query service, if it resolves | `<release>-query` | `query.config.keys.transit.openbao.login.role` | resolve |

Give each component a role of its own. Each is a
separate privilege, and one identity holding two of them is the thing the
separation exists to prevent.

### Signing in

Each component signs in with its **projected service-account token**. The
component's `tokens` entry mounts one with the audience the JWT role expects
(`openbao`), which the kubelet replaces before it expires, and the
configuration names the file in `login.jwtFile`:

```yaml
keys:
  provider: transit
  transit:
    prefix: audit
    openbao:
      address: https://openbao.example.com:8200
      mount: transit
      login:
        mount: jwt-devel
        role: audit-writer
        jwtFile: /var/run/openbao/token
```

with `tokens: [{audience: openbao, mountPath: /var/run/openbao}]` beside the
`config:` in the chart. The component presents the token on `login.mount`
under its role, and signs in again once three quarters of the session's lease
has passed, or at once if the engine refuses a session that was revoked early.
No token is stored anywhere, so there is nothing to leak and nothing to rotate.

A token file (`tokenFile`) or a token named by `tokenSecret` (the name of a
secret that the file's `secrets` block says how to find: an environment variable,
a file or an SSM parameter) is accepted instead, for an engine that is not
set up for JWT logins; exactly one of the three. `audit key destroy`, run from
an operator's shell, takes `BAO_ADDR`, `BAO_NAMESPACE`, `BAO_CACERT` and
`BAO_TOKEN`, or the `VAULT_` names.

If the engine's certificate comes from a private chain, give the chart that
chain's bundle as `trust.configMap` and name the file in `openbao.caFile`
(`/etc/audit/trust/<key>`). trust-manager's ConfigMap is the usual source.
Every pod mounts it.

### Policies

Written here as HCL to show their shape. Where policies are generated from
configuration, as they should be, these are what the generator must produce,
and the tests below run each one as its own token.

The dot after the purpose keeps `billing` from also matching `billing2`.

The **writer** pseudonymises and seals for every profile it writes, and
creates keys through the encrypt endpoint:

```hcl
path "transit/hmac/audit.security.*"    { capabilities = ["update"] }
path "transit/encrypt/audit.security.*" { capabilities = ["create", "update"] }
path "transit/hmac/audit.billing.*"     { capabilities = ["update"] }
path "transit/encrypt/audit.billing.*"  { capabilities = ["create", "update"] }
# … one pair per profile
```

It has **nothing on `transit/keys/`**. A grant there would reach `rotate`,
`config` and `trim`, which together are erasure. That is why keys are created
through `encrypt` (the engine creates a missing key there when the policy
grants `create`) and never through `transit/keys`.

A **metering** or any other single-purpose role gets its own purpose only:

```hcl
path "transit/hmac/audit.billing.*" { capabilities = ["update"] }
```

The **query service**, if it may resolve, opens sealed identifiers for the
profiles it resolves:

```hcl
path "transit/decrypt/audit.security.*" { capabilities = ["update"] }
```

The **erasure operator**, who runs `audit key destroy`. This is a person, so
it is granted to a human group rather than to a workload's role:

```hcl
path "transit/keys/audit.*"    { capabilities = ["read", "update"] }
path "transit/encrypt/audit.*" { capabilities = ["create", "update"] }
```

The glob reaches `rotate`, `config` and `trim` under each key, which is what
destroy uses. (A `+` wildcard only matches a whole path segment, so it cannot
be combined with the prefix to name those three alone.) The encrypt grant is
for a tenant destroyed before it was ever seen: its key is created and
destroyed at once.

**Nobody** gets `delete` on `transit/keys/audit.*`, and no key is configured
with `deletion_allowed`. A deleted key would be created afresh the next time
the tenant appears. The same person would then get a second identity, and
nothing would say so.

### Destroying a key

```
audit key destroy --tenant <id> --purpose <p> --by <who> --reason <why> \
    --bucket <b> --sink <writer> --key-provider transit
```

The provider rotates the key once, raises its minimum decryption and
encryption versions past the first, and then trims the first version away.
What is left is a key whose only version nothing uses:

- HMAC, encrypt and decrypt under version 1 are refused, so no pseudonym can be
  recomputed and no sealed identifier opens;
- the engine refuses to lower the minimum version again once it is trimmed;
- creating the key again changes nothing, because it exists.

The key is its own erasure marker, the one the `local` provider writes as a
file. A tenant destroyed before it was ever seen gets a key made and destroyed
at once, so it stays erased when it does appear.

**Backups.** Trimming removes the version from the engine's storage, but a
snapshot taken before still holds it, and restoring that snapshot brings the
key back. Erasure is complete once the last such snapshot has aged out.
Publish that period with the retention terms.

### Testing

The provider's tests run against a real dev server and skip without one:

```sh
docker run -d --rm --name bao -p 8200:8200 -e BAO_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=root \
    openbao/openbao:2.4.1 server -dev -dev-listen-address=0.0.0.0:8200
AUDIT_OPENBAO_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8200 AUDIT_OPENBAO_TOKEN=root go test ./keys/ ./internal/writer/
```

They cover:

- two writers with separate stores agreeing on a pseudonym;
- purposes and tenants not joining;
- destroy leaving a tombstone that a fresh provider respects;
- a login with a projected token inside a namespace, signing in again after the
  lease runs out and after a revoke, and a token for the wrong audience refused
  at start-up;
- the transit signer, kept for seals, signing in the same way;
- every policy on this page run as its own token: a single-purpose role refuses
  another purpose and cannot destroy, the writer seals but cannot open, resolve
  opens and does nothing else, and the eraser destroys but cannot delete.

The private-chain handshake is tested without a server, in the ordinary suite.

## Afterwards

- Test the setup as described under *Testing* below, then `audit key destroy` (see [erase a tenant's keys](erase-a-tenants-keys.md)) on a test tenant.
- Record the engine, namespace and role names in the deployment's own decision log.
