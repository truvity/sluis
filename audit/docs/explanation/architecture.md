# Architecture

One installation belongs to one application. This page says what the parts
are, what each holds and must never hold, how the application's catalogue
binds them together, what an acknowledgement means, and what can be lost.

[Concepts](concepts.md) defines the vocabulary. The
[deployment pages](direct-mode.md) show each shape as it is actually
run. The [decisions](../decisions/README.md) say why, starting with
[0011](../decisions/0011-one-installation-per-service-or-product.md).

This page describes what is built. The target architecture — three parts
installed independently over a versioned bucket contract, a sink
acknowledgement that says how durable it is, and signed seals — is in the
decisions from
[0016](../decisions/0016-three-parts-installed-independently.md) to
[0023](../decisions/0023-archive-retention-and-lifecycle.md), the
[bucket contract](../reference/bucket-contract.md) and the
[capabilities](../reference/capabilities.md) matrix, which says what exists on each
platform. Where they differ from this page, this page is the present and
they are the direction.

| part | runs as | holds | never holds |
|---|---|---|---|
| **emit** | a library in the application (`emit`) | the compiled-in catalogue, a bounded in-memory queue | credentials for the bucket, the index or the stream |
| **receiver** | `audit-writer`, one or two pods, the application's front door over Connect | the stream's credentials in stream mode, and it serves `RegisterCatalogue` | — |
| **writer** | the same image in consumer mode, N pods (stream mode); the receiver itself (direct mode) | write rights on its prefix, a database role for the dedupe table and the registry | the index, and any way to hand a record back to a caller |
| **stream** | one JetStream stream on the application's own account (stream mode only) | records not yet archived, replicated | — |
| **bucket** | one per environment, Object Lock in compliance mode where a profile demands it | every record, one copy per profile, locked where the profile demands it | — |
| **indexer** | `audit-observe`, one pod ([0020](../decisions/0020-observe-follows-the-bucket.md), [0024](../decisions/0024-indexer-and-query-are-separate-processes.md)) | read on the archive, its own database role: the index and its cursors | write on the archive, the dedupe table |
| **index** | one database in the application's existing Postgres | rows, facet counts, cursors, rollups, and the writer's dedupe table and registry beside them under another role | anything that is not rebuildable |
| **notary** | `audit-notary`, an hourly CronJob | read on the prefix, put under `seals/`, the seal key | write on `records/`; the writer's identity |
| **verify** | a CronJob | read on the prefix, and nothing else | write rights on the archive |
| **query service** | `audit-query`, one or two pods | a read-only index role, read on the prefix, the application's grants | write on the archive or the index |
| **Audit page** | a React component in the application's console | nothing — it calls the query service with the console's own token | credentials of its own |
| **usage consumer** | a small Deployment, [quotas](../how-to/enable-usage-quotas.md) only | the counter cache | — |

Two things follow from the table. The application holds no credentials for
anything the trail is kept in, so a compromised application pod cannot reach
the archive except by emitting records. And nothing in the write path can
read a record back out: the query service is the only way in, and it records
every read.

## The catalogue is the contract

One YAML file lives next to the application's code, with a JSON Schema for
each action that carries data. It names every action the application
records and, for each, what kind of operation it is, what frameworks call
it, which profiles keep a copy (and therefore for how long), what it is
about, who may act, the schema of its data, its delivery, and how it reads
as a sentence.

```mermaid

  CAT["catalogue<br/>one YAML plus data schemas<br/>in the application's repository"]
  CAT --> CI["CI: audit validate, check-emitters<br/>the code emits exactly what is declared"]
  CAT --> EM["emit library<br/>refuses a record that does not match,<br/>before it leaves the application"]

  CAT --> Q["query service and Audit page<br/>render each record as its sentence,<br/>know the facets"]
  CAT --> S3[("archive: schema/…<br/>a copy of every version ever used")]
```

- **One per application, not shared.** What is shared, and shipped here, is
  the format and the [framework profiles](../../profiles/README.md) that profiles are
  composed from. A catalogue names profiles; it never defines them.
- **Versioned with the code.** Every record names the catalogue version it
  was written under, and the archive keeps a copy of every version, so a
  record written last year still reads correctly after the catalogue
  changed.
- **It reaches the receiver at start-up**, over `RegisterCatalogue`. A
  malformed catalogue is refused and the application does not start; a
  receiver that is merely unreachable is retried. There is no registry
  service: the receiver serves that call, because an installation has one
  application to hear it from
  ([0011](../decisions/0011-one-installation-per-service-or-product.md)).
- **One constructor per action in the application's code**, so the name is
  spelled once and `check-emitters` can hold the code to the file.

[The catalogue reference](../reference/catalogue.md) is the full format.

## What an acknowledgement means

Delivery is chosen per action in the catalogue, not per installation.

| delivery | the application's call returns | if the receiver is down | for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `block` | when the receiver has acknowledged durability | the action **fails** | a privileged sign-in, a key destruction, a billable operation |
| `async` (default) | at once | the record waits in a bounded queue and is retried with backoff | everything else |

**The acknowledgement says how durable the batch is.** `Archived` is the
object in the bucket: the receiver puts every batch it takes before answering,
in direct mode. `Queued` is a replicated queue's acknowledgement, from a
stream or an SQS queue. `Logged` is a line in the process's log. The
difference between the deliveries is only who waits — the application under
`block`, its own queue under `async`. A chain's start-up guard,
`sink.Require`, refuses one that can never give what the deployment needs.
[0017](../decisions/0017-sink-durability-and-transports.md) has the reasoning;
it supersedes [0012](../decisions/0012-two-deliveries-and-a-durable-ack.md).

## What each mode can lose

A `block` record is never lost in either mode: the application had no
acknowledgement to act on. For `async`:

| what happens | direct mode | stream mode |
|---|---|---|
| the application's pod dies with records still queued | whatever has not been acknowledged: one flush interval of records (default one second) plus the batch in flight | the same, and shorter, because a publish is quicker than a put |
| the writer dies with records gathered from the stream | not applicable | nothing: they were never acknowledged to the stream, which redelivers them |
| the receiver or writer crashes | nothing — it acknowledged nothing it had not stored | nothing |
| a long receiver outage overflows the queue | the oldest are dropped and counted | the same, but a replicated stream makes the outage a rollout's seconds |
| the application's container restarts, pod intact | the queue is gone, as in the first row | the same |

Every record the queue gives up is written to the application's log by the
emitter, with its identifier and the reason. A record lost with a dying pod
cannot be, and what remains of it is whatever the application logged about
the action. Watch `audit.emit.queue.pending`, which tells you a queue is
filling, and alert on `audit.emit.records.dropped`, which tells you one
overflowed.

Graceful shutdown of a receiver or writer is readiness off, flush the roll,
exit. Two direct-mode replicas are safe because the dedupe table is in
Postgres, not in a pod.

## Batching, not aggregation

Neither the receiver nor the writer ever combines two records into one.
Every record is stored as it was emitted. What they do is **batch** — many
records become one object per profile, tenant and day per batch taken. In
stream mode the writer gathers across fetches first — up to a size, a count or
a window of no more than half a minute — so that a trickle of records does not
become a trickle of objects
— and keep **projections beside the records**: index rows, facet counts,
rollups, usage counters. Every projection can be recomputed from the archive
with `audit reindex`, which is why none of them is backed up and none of
them is the record.

## The life of one record

1. **The application records an action.** The emitter fills what it knows (id,
   time, source, sequence, the request's client address and ids), validates the
   record against the catalogue — the action exists, the data matches its
   schema, nothing on the negative list is present — and delivers it as the
   catalogue declares.
2. **The receiver stamps what it verified itself**: `recorded_at`, the observer
   taken from the caller's verified token, and the `origin_hash` over the
   canonical form. A caller never says who it is. In stream mode the stamping
   has to happen here, because the writers on the other side read messages and
   have no caller to verify; they keep a stamp whose hash still describes its
   record, and stamp afresh one that does not.
3. **The writer splits the record** into one copy per profile the action names.
   Each copy keeps only the fields that profile's framework profiles allow (default-deny),
   and each identity is treated by its category: kept in clear, replaced by a
   keyed pseudonym, or dropped. With `keys.provider: none` — the default — there
   are no pseudonyms, and
   [0013](../decisions/0013-no-pseudonymisation-keys-by-default.md) says what the
   deployment must declare instead.
4. **It rolls copies into objects** — one per ingest batch, profile and tenant,
   keyed by the hour of ingest — and puts each under an Object Lock retention
   computed from the profile: a fixed number of days, or years after the thing
   the record is about expires. Nothing is acknowledged before the object is in
   the bucket. A record the writer cannot take goes to the dead-letter prefix,
   never nowhere.
5. **It marks** the record's id as written, so that a redelivery is absorbed
   exactly once. The writer does not index: the indexer finds the object by
   listing the bucket from its cursor once it is older than the settle window,
   and writes each copy's row and facet counts a couple of minutes later
   ([0020](../decisions/0020-observe-follows-the-bucket.md)).
6. **Every night the verify job** checks the previous day's objects against the
   [bucket contract](../reference/bucket-contract.md) — each object's key, metadata
   and bytes, and the hash of every record — and records what it checked. Seals
   ([0019](../decisions/0019-seals.md)), which say that nothing was removed or
   added, are made hourly by the notary and checked with `--root`.
7. **A reader asks** through the query service. Their token names them; the
   grants say which profiles, tenants, operations and period they may read, and
   the grant becomes one more term of the query, so there is no path to a row
   outside it. The read is itself recorded.

The installation keeps its own account of itself in the archive it writes,
and every job records what it did, so the trail says when it was and was not
being kept.

## The two shapes

| | [direct](direct-mode.md) | [stream](stream-mode.md) |
|---|---|---|
| for | an internal service, low volume, or a cluster with no stream | a product: many pods, metering, quotas |
| the receiver | is the writer: it puts to the bucket | publishes to JetStream |
| writers | the receiver's own pods | N consumers, scaled apart |
| `async` loss window | one flush interval, plus the batch in flight | the same, and shorter |
| needs | a bucket, a database | a bucket, a database, a NATS account |

Switching an installation from direct to stream is a change to the
receiver's configuration. It does not change a single record, because the
archive's layout is the same either way — which is also why two
installations on different versions can share one bucket.

## Extensions

Both are projections of the same records, switched on per installation, and
neither puts anything new in the request path.

- [Billing](../how-to/enable-billing.md): rollups at index time and an
  immutable monthly statement.
- [Usage quotas](../how-to/enable-usage-quotas.md): a second stream consumer
  counting into a cache, a decision point in front of the application, and
  an hourly reconciler that corrects the cache from the index.
