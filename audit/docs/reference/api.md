# API reference

Contracts: [sink.proto](../../proto/audit/v1/sink.proto),
[registry.proto](../../proto/audit/v1/registry.proto),
[query.proto](../../proto/audit/v1/query.proto). Served over ConnectRPC;
JSON is snake_case, timestamps RFC 3339. As in all proto3 JSON, a field
at its zero value is omitted, so a search that matches nothing returns no
`items` key at all rather than an empty list; read absence as empty.

Two processes serve these. The **receiver** (`audit-writer`) serves
`SinkService` and `RegistryService`; the **query service** (`audit-query`)
serves `QueryService`. There is no third service and no `audit-registry`
binary: an installation has one application to hear a catalogue from, so the
process that validates every record against the catalogue is also the one
that accepts it
([0011](../decisions/0011-one-installation-per-service-or-product.md)).

## Write

`audit.v1.SinkService/Write` — a batch of records with a delivery.
Reachable by the application's workloads and by adapters; never by browsers.

The response says how many were accepted, lists each `Rejection` by id
with a machine-readable reason, and names the batch's `Durability`. A whole batch is refused before any record
is accepted when the refusal is structural — an unknown catalogue version, a
schema violation.

There are two deliveries, `block` and `async`
([0012](../decisions/0012-two-deliveries-and-a-durable-ack.md)), and the
acknowledgement says how durable the batch is
([0017](../decisions/0017-sink-durability-and-transports.md)).

| the catalogue says | on the wire | the call returns |
|---|---|---|
| `block` | `DELIVERY_BLOCK` | when the records are durable at the next hop |
| `async` (the default) | `DELIVERY_ASYNC` | at once; the record waits in the emitter's bounded queue |

| `durability` | means |
|---|---|
| `DURABILITY_ARCHIVED` | the records are in the archive's bucket; the writer's own put reports this |
| `DURABILITY_QUEUED` | a durable, replicated queue holds them: the JetStream and SQS publishers report this, after every acknowledgement |
| `DURABILITY_LOGGED` | the process wrote them to its log |
| `DURABILITY_UNSPECIFIED` | the hop did not say, which counts as weaker than all of the above |

The values are ordered, a higher number surviving more, and a hop reports what
the last hop that took the batch reported: a receiver forwards its next hop's
answer, and a wrapper never reports more than its successor did. The field was
added to the response without renumbering, so a caller built before it reads
`UNSPECIFIED`.

In Go, a sink declares the best it will ever report with `Guarantees()`;
`sink.Require(s, min)` refuses a chain that cannot give `min` when the process
starts, and `sink.Guard(s, min)` does that and also fails any write whose
acknowledgement is weaker at run time. A Connect client cannot know what the
far side is configured to give, so `Client.Expecting` says.

`DELIVERY_OUTBOX` and `DELIVERY_BEST_EFFORT` stay in the enum, deprecated. A
value removed is a record nobody can read, and this package is `v1`, so they
remain decodable and nothing produces them: the catalogue loader refuses both
spellings by name. `DELIVERY_OUTBOX` never reached the wire in any case — it
named a mode of the emitter, and the file it named is gone.

## Catalogue registration

`audit.v1.RegistryService/RegisterCatalogue`, `GetCatalogue`,
`ListCatalogues` — **served by the receiver**, on the same port as `Write`.

The application calls `RegisterCatalogue` at start-up with the catalogue
document and the JSON Schemas of its extension slots. An empty `problems`
list means registered; a malformed catalogue comes back with its findings
and the application does not start. The first use of a version copies it
into the archive, beside the records it describes, so a record written under
it still reads after the catalogue changed.

`GetCatalogue` and `ListCatalogues` answer what this installation has been
told. An installation admits one application, so the list is short and the
source is the one the receiver verified.

## Query

`audit.v1.QueryService/Search`:

```json
{
  "profile": "security",
  "filter": [
    {
      "occurred_at": {"between": {"from": "2026-09-01T00:00:00Z", "to": "2026-09-17T00:00:00Z"}},
      "action":      {"prefix": "wallet.credential."},
      "outcome":     {"in": {"values": ["failure", "denied"]}},
      "targets":     {"in": {"values": [{"type": "credential"}]}}
    },
    { "actor_id": {"equal": "…"} }
  ],
  "sort": [{"field": "FIELD_OCCURRED_AT", "order": "ORDER_DESC"}, {"field": "FIELD_ID", "order": "ORDER_ASC"}],
  "limit": 100
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "items": [ … ],
  "query": { "profile": "security", "filter": [ … ], "sort": [ … ], "limit": 100 },
  "cursors": { "self": "…", "first": "…", "prev": "…", "next": "…" }
}
```

`first` is a cursor like the others and means this same question from the
beginning, so a client holds one kind of cursor rather than two. There is no
`last`: counting what is behind a query is the expense keyset paging exists to
avoid.

Operators per type. **Built** is what the service compiles today; the rest are
in the proto and are refused, because a reference that promises an operator the
service ignores is worse than one that admits the gap.

| type | operators | built |
|---|---|---|
| string | equal, not_equal, in, not_in, prefix | yes |
| string | is_null, is_not_null | no |
| time | between, greater_than, greater_than_or_equal, less_than, less_than_or_equal | yes, each as a half-open range |
| integer | equal | yes |
| integer | not_equal, in, not_in, between, comparisons | no |
| targets | in, not_in (empty id matches the type) | yes |
| attributes | equal, not_equal, key_is_null, key_is_not_null | no |
| data path | string, integer or time predicate on a filterable property | yes |

A predicate on `id` takes whole identifiers: record ids are UUIDs, so a value
that is not one, or a `prefix`, is `invalid_argument`. `Get` of an id that is
not a UUID is `not_found`.

`Facets` counts values of fields under the same filter:

```json
{"profile": "security", "filter": [ … ], "fields": ["action", "outcome"], "limit_per_field": 10}
→ {"facets": [{"field": "action", "values": [{"value": "shop.order.placed", "count": "42"}]}]}
```

`Get` returns one record and where its copy is. `digest_id` and `verified_at`
are for the seal that covers it and when that was last verified clean; they are
empty until seals ([0019](../decisions/0019-seals.md)) set them:

```json
{"profile": "security", "id": "0199b100-…"}
→ {"record": { … },
   "provenance": {"object_key": "records/security/acme/2026/09/17/10/01K5…", "line": "3",
                  "digest_id": "", "verified_at": ""}}
```

`Export` starts a job over a filter; `GetExport` polls it and, when ready,
returns a signed link that expires:

```json
{"profile": "security", "filter": [ … ], "format": "FORMAT_NDJSON"}
→ {"job_id": "x-…", "state": "EXPORT_STATE_PENDING"}

{"job_id": "x-…"}
→ {"state": "EXPORT_STATE_READY", "url": "https://…", "expires_at": "…", "records": "1204"}
```

64-bit integers (`count`, `line`, `records`) are strings in JSON, as proto3
JSON maps them. Limits, enforced by the
service rather than by whichever searcher is configured: `filter` 4 terms,
`sort` 4, `in` 100 values, `limit` ceiling 1000, and an export size cap. A
grant's window narrows a wider request rather than refusing it.

## Access

`audit.v1.QueryService/Access` says what the caller may read: every profile a
grant names, with the operations the caller holds on it over at least one
tenant, the tenants, and the period.

```json
{}
→ {"profiles": [
    {"profile": "security", "operations": ["search", "facets", "get", "tail", "export"],
     "all_tenants": true},
    {"profile": "history", "operations": ["search", "get"], "tenants": ["acme"],
     "from": "2026-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
  ]}
```

It is the same grants and the same rule every other call is held to, so a
page can offer what the caller may open without its host knowing the
deployment's profile names; `AuditView` asks it when the host passes no
profiles. It reads no record and is not recorded. A profile a grant names
with no tenant to read it over is not listed.

## Resolve

`audit.v1.QueryService/Resolve` maps a pseudonym back to the identity behind
it: `{"profile": "security", "tenant_id": "acme", "pseudonym": "ps_…"}` →
`{"identifier": "…"}`. Pseudonyms differ per profile, so name the profile whose
copy carried it.

**It is `unimplemented` in a deployment with no key provider, which is the
default** ([0013](../decisions/0013-no-pseudonymisation-keys-by-default.md)):
where nothing was pseudonymised there is nothing to resolve, and the service
says so rather than returning nothing. The rest of this section describes a
deployment that has chosen a provider.

It needs the `resolve` operation on that profile, which no read grant implies
and no group name grants — only an explicit rule. The tenant must be one the
grant covers. The resolution is recorded as `audit.pseudonym.resolved`, and
the record confirmed, **before** the identity is returned; if the trail cannot
take it, nothing is resolved. The record names the pseudonym and the rule,
never the identity. The service offers resolve only when it is given the keys
(`keys` and `archive` in `audit-query`'s configuration: the local
provider with `keys.local.rootFile` and `.dir`, or `transit` with a login that
may decrypt); otherwise
`unimplemented`.

Only actor and subject pseudonyms resolve. The writer keeps each one's
identifier sealed under the same tenant's key (`identity/` in the archive), so
destroying the key — erasure — makes resolving impossible: `failed_precondition`.
Values hashed by `x-audit-sensitive: hmac` are findable and never readable, and
have no way back.

## Errors

Connect codes:

| code | when |
|---|---|
| `invalid_argument` | a malformed filter, or a cursor from a different query |
| `permission_denied` | the grant excludes the profile, the operation or the tenant |
| `resource_exhausted` | a published limit exceeded, or an export over its cap |
| `failed_precondition` | resolve of a pseudonym whose tenant key was destroyed — erasure did what it is for; retrying never helps |
| `not_found` | no such record — **also** what a record outside the grant returns, because "no such record" and "a record you may not read" are the same answer to somebody who should not know it exists |
| `unimplemented` | something this deployment does not offer: resolve with no key provider, export with no bucket configured |
| `unavailable` | the searcher is down |

`unavailable` is the default for anything unrecognised, deliberately. Calling a
searcher outage `invalid_argument` would tell a well-behaved client never to try
again, and turn a database restart into an outage that outlives it.
