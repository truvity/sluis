// Command audit-writer is an installation's front door and its write path,
// which are one process in a small installation and two in a busy one.
//
// With mode writer, the default, it does both: it serves the sink, puts the
// copies their profiles keep, and consumes a stream when one is configured.
// With mode receiver it only takes records and publishes them to the stream,
// holding no bucket and no keys; the writers consume the other end. That split
// is what lets the write path scale away from the front door, and what keeps
// the stream's credentials out of the application entirely.
//
// It takes records and puts the copies their profiles keep, and it accepts the
// application's catalogue at start-up (RegisterCatalogue) — an installation
// belongs to one application, so a registry service of its own would be a
// Deployment for a single call. It is the only component that writes to the
// archive, and the only one that holds the pseudonymisation keys where a
// deployment configures any. Everything else either hands it records or reads
// what it wrote.
//
// It is configured by one file, --config, validated against
// schemas/config/audit-writer.schema.json before anything starts; the
// environment adds only the secrets that file names, and OpenTelemetry's own
// OTEL_* variables say where telemetry goes. See
// docs/decisions/0021-one-validated-configuration-file.md.
