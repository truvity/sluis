// fails the whole batch, only for what no message is to blame for.
//
// A batch is written as one call to the writer, which is all-or-nothing about
// the copies it was handed: it returns once every record is in the archive, was
// seen before, or was dead-lettered. So the outcomes are:
//
//   - the write succeeds: every message that decoded is archived and is not
//     reported, which is what makes SQS delete it;
//   - the write fails: every message that decoded is reported and comes back
//     after the visibility timeout, and the writer's deduplication absorbs any
//     of them that did land;
//   - the sink refuses a record by id: that message is reported, and after
//     maxReceiveCount deliveries lands in the DLQ, where an alarm is on it;
//   - a message that is not a record: reported at once, for the same reason. A
//     poison message is the DLQ's job, and silently deleting it would be a
//     record lost without anyone being told.
