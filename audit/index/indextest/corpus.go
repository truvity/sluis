// Package indextest is the one corpus every searcher is asked about.
//
// Three implementations of index.Searcher ship — memory, Postgres and a scan of
// the archive — and until this package existed each had its own test fixture
// and its own questions. That arrangement can only find the bugs someone
// thought to ask each of them about separately. It cannot find the one that
// matters most, which is two searchers answering the same question differently:
// a reader who moves a deployment from the scan to the index, or reads a
// replica while the primary is down, would see the trail change, and a trail
// that changes depending on who is asked is not evidence of anything.
//
// So the corpus is defined once, as records, and loaded into each searcher the
// way that searcher is fed in production — derived into rows for the indexers,
// written as archive objects for the scan. The expected answers are written out
// literally rather than computed, because an expectation derived from one
// implementation makes that implementation the definition and proves only that
// the others copy it.
