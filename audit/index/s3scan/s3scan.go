// Package s3scan answers queries by reading the archive, with no index at all.
//
// It exists for a deployment too small to run a database, and as the third
// implementation of the Searcher interface — the one that cannot cheat. A
// searcher backed by a table can quietly grow a capability the interface never
// promised; one that must open objects and read them cannot, so it keeps the
// contract honest about what a query is allowed to ask.
//
// What it gives up is stated rather than hidden. It walks days newest first and
// reads every object of each, so a query over a year is a year of reading. That
// is bounded by a budget: a scan stops when it has spent it and hands back a
// cursor, rather than running until something times out and leaving the caller
// with nothing.
//
// A day here is a day of INGEST time, because that is what the v1 layout keys
// objects by (docs/reference/audit/bucket-contract.md): records/<profile>/<tenant>/
// <yyyy>/<mm>/<dd>/<hh>/<ULID>. Rows are ordered by occurred_at within an
// ingest day, so a record that was ingested late sorts among the records of the
// day it arrived, not the day it happened. A query that names a period of
// occurred_at reads the ingest days from its start to its end plus Lateness,
// and a record that arrived later than that is not found by it; the index has
// no such limit, which is one more reason a deployment of any size runs one.
