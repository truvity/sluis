// This is the searcher a deployment of any size actually runs, and the one with
// the most room to drift: its answers come out of SQL rather than out of the
// Go that derives the rows, so a predicate can be translated into something
// that means almost the same thing and nothing notices. Asking it the same
// questions as the memory searcher and the scan is what makes "almost" show up.
