// Queue is what a process that takes records off a queue reports about the
// queue: how long a message waited.
//
// The age of a message at receive is the number to watch, and a depth is not:
// a deep queue that is draining is healthy, and a shallow one whose oldest
// message is an hour old is not. The depth and the DLQ are the platform's own
// metrics (CloudWatch's ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage and
// ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible), and the alarms on them are in
// deploy/pulumi; this is the per-message view that says whether the writer is
// keeping up and by how much.
