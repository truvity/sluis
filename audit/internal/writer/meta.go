// The writer's account of itself.
//
// A component that writes an audit trail and keeps no trail of its own asks to
// be taken on trust, and this one is not entitled to that: a reader who cannot
// tell a quiet hour from a stopped writer cannot conclude anything from the
// archive's silence. So the writer emits about itself, and it does so into
// itself, over the in-process sink. That is a loop by construction and it is
// the right one. The writer's account lands in the same archive, under the same
// profiles, in the same signed digests, and there is no second path to keep
// honest.
//
// Two rules keep the loop from turning on itself.
//
// Delivery is async whatever the catalogue declares, because a blocking
// write from inside the writer's own batch would wait on its own flush, and
// because failing to record that a record was dead-lettered must not also fail
// the dead-lettering. The emitter is marked SelfReporting, which says this in
// the one place delivery is chosen.
//
// And a meta-record that cannot itself be written is dead-lettered and reported
// through the hooks, never emitted about. Without that, one malformed
// meta-record would beget another for as long as the process ran.

// metaKey marks a batch as the writer's own, which is how the two rules above
// are enforced: a dead letter under this marker is not emitted about, and the
// observer identity is the writer's own rather than a transport's.
