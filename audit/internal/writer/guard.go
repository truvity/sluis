// GuardReplicas refuses a configuration whose deduplication cannot do its job.
//
// Every hop below the writer is at-least-once, and the writer's deduplication
// is what makes that safe. An in-process table only makes one process's own
// repeats safe: with two replicas behind one stream, a redelivery that lands on
// the other replica is written twice, and a duplicated billing record is an
// invoice nobody can defend.
//
// The failure is silent by nature — two copies of a record look exactly like
// two records — so this refuses at start-up rather than waiting for somebody to
// notice. A deployment that genuinely wants one replica says so by running one.

// minted, which names nobody without that application's own database.

// saying anything, and writing whatever arrives into an archive nothing can
// edit. See docs/decisions/0055-no-pseudonymisation-keys-by-default.md.
