// Dedupe remembers which records have been written.
//
// Every hop below the writer is at-least-once on purpose: the emitter's queue repeats
// what it could not confirm, the stream redelivers what was not acknowledged,
// and a retry after a timeout is the safe thing for a caller to do. This is
// where those repeats stop, and it is why none of them has to be careful.
//
// Asking and marking are two calls, and the order matters. The writer asks
// before it writes and marks only after the copies are durable. The other
// order — claim first, write second — reads better and is wrong for any store
// that outlives the process: a crash between the claim and the put would leave
// the identifier marked and the record nowhere, and the redelivery that would
// have saved it arrives looking like a duplicate. Marking afterwards can only
// go the other way, into a second copy of a record already written, and that
// costs an object: the index keeps one row per identifier and the digest chain
// accounts for both objects. A duplicate is a cost. A loss is a hole in an
// audit trail, and this component exists so that there are none.

// documented rather than hidden behind an interface that pretends they are the
