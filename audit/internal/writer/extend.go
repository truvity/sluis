// Addenda: lengthening the lock on evidence already written.
//
// An after_expiry profile keeps a record until the credential it is about has
// expired, plus the profile's years. The writer locks an object for that when
// it writes it, but the credential's life is not always settled then: a renewal
// extends it after issuance, and an identity proofing is relied on by
// credentials issued long after it. A record that says so — its catalogue
// declares the action `extends` the records a data property names — makes the
// writer lengthen the lock on the objects holding those records to the new
// expiry plus the years.
//
// Compliance mode allows lengthening a lock and never shortening it, so this
// is safe to do at any time and undoes nothing; a later, shorter expiry leaves
// the lock as it is. It is done after the addendum is durable, so that the
// extension is never ahead of the record that asked for it, and it never fails
// the batch: the addendum is written either way, and a failure is recorded
// in the trail and counted instead, for an operator to repeat by hand.

// Locator finds the object an earlier record is in. Every index.Searcher is
// one; without an index, a scan finds records within its budget and says so
// when it gives up.
