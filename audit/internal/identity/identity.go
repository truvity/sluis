// Package identity is the way back from a pseudonym to the person, for the
// cases the law requires and only for them.
//
// A pseudonym is a keyed hash, and a hash does not run backwards. So when the
// writer pseudonymises an actor or a subject, it also keeps the identifier,
// sealed under the same tenant's key for the same purpose, in the archive:
// identity/tenant=<t>/purpose=<p>/<pseudonym>. Whoever resolves must hold that
// key; nobody else can open the entry. And destroying the key — erasure —
// makes every sealed identifier under it unreadable with it, so crypto-shredding
// still means what it says.
//
// The entries live in the archive rather than the index for durability's sake:
// an entry the writer failed to keep can never be recreated, since the plain
// identifier exists nowhere else, so it is written with the same guarantees as
// the records and does not depend on the database being up.
//
// Only identities are kept: actors and subjects. Extension values marked
// x-audit-sensitive: hmac are hashed to be findable and never readable, and
// no way back is kept for them.
