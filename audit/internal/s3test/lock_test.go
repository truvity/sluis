// TestALockedObjectSurvivesBeingDeleted is the archive's central claim, asked of
// a bucket rather than of a comment.
//
// Everything else in this repository — the seals, the holds, the writer's
// refusal to reuse a key — is built on the belief that once bytes are in the
// archive nobody can take them out. That belief had never been put to a bucket:
// the tamper tests run against a memory store that refuses deletion because it
// was written to refuse deletion, which proves only that the double agrees with
// itself.
//
// Three deletions are attempted here, and the interesting thing is that two of
// them are meant to succeed. S3 does not stop a delete; it stops data being
// lost. A delete without a version leaves a marker over bytes that are still
// there, and a second write makes a new version beside the old one rather than
// on top of it. Only removing the version itself would destroy anything, and
// that is what the retention refuses.
