// Package s3test gives a test a real S3 to walk.
//
// The archive walks are the part of this repository that has been wrong twice,
// and both times the tests passed: a walk that covered one tenant, and a
// listing that stopped at the first thousand keys. Both hid behind
// storetest.Memory, which returns everything, in any layout, on one page. A
// double kinder than the thing it stands in for is not a test.
//
// So these tests run against LocalStack, which pages ListObjectsV2 at a
// thousand like AWS and honours Delimiter and continuation tokens the same way.
//
// What it does and does not enforce was measured rather than assumed, because
// the first version of this comment guessed and guessed wrong. It refuses to
// delete a version held by a compliance retention, which is the guarantee the
// whole archive rests on and is asserted here. It does not implement
// PutObjectRetention at all — it answers MethodNotAllowed where AWS answers
// AccessDenied — so nothing here may claim that a retention cannot be
// shortened. That claim is checked against real S3 instead, on demand, by the
// test in realbucket_test.go.
