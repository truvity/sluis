// Package health serves a process's readiness: whether it can do its work now,
// as against /healthz, which says only that the process is up and answering.
//
// A pod that is up and cannot reach its database is not one to send traffic to
// and not one to restart (a restart does not bring the database back), so the
// two are different questions with different probes: liveness reads /healthz,
// readiness reads /readyz. Readiness never reports why beyond the name of what
// failed: the endpoint is reachable by anything that can reach the pod, and an
// error from a dependency can carry an address.
