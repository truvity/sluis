// writer. The jobs need the same for the same reason, and more sharply: a chain
// that is never sealed and a chain sealed over an empty hour look identical in
// the archive, and a verification that never ran looks exactly like one that
// found nothing wrong. Without these events the only evidence that the jobs
// exist is that somebody is watching their exit codes.
//
// Every action goes through the common catalogue and is validated against it
// like anyone else's. A job whose own records bypassed the contract would be
// asking to be trusted about the one thing it exists to prove.
