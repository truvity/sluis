// ClockSync compares this machine's clock with UTC and records the answer.

// synchronisation be recorded. The recording is the half that belongs here:
// every timestamp in the archive is this machine's opinion of the time, and an
// auditor who cannot see that the opinion was checked has to take the ordering
// of the whole trail on faith.
//
// It does not set the clock. Whatever runs the machine does that, and a
// component that both set the time and recorded the times of things would be
// marking its own paper.
