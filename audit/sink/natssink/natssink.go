// Package natssink publishes records to a NATS JetStream stream, and consumes
// them again on the other side.
//
// The stream is a buffer with a bounded horizon, not a store: the writer's put
// into object storage is where durability begins. What the stream gives is a
// business-visible acknowledgement — a publish that returns means the record is
// on the stream's disks and will be delivered — and replay for as long as the
// horizon holds.

// emitter's retry, but a block record fails the action it was recording. Such
// records are published again, within the same timeout, once the connection is
// back. The message id makes that harmless: a record whose acknowledgement was
