// package, and the promises are the writer's rather than the binary's. Nothing

// is dead-lettered and never dropped, and the writer keeps an account of
// itself in the archive it writes.
//
// It is exported because the binary needs it and a test may. It is not a way
// to deploy: a writer inside an application puts the archive's credentials in
// the application's pods and makes every fix an application release, which
// docs/decisions/0011-one-installation-per-service-or-product.md rules out.
