// Package keys holds the two kinds of key this system needs and the interfaces
// a deployment plugs its own behind.
//
// A Provider gives the symmetric keys that turn an identifier into a keyed
// pseudonym. There is one key per tenant and per purpose, which is what stops
// two copies of the same event being joined on a person: the security copy and
// the billing copy of one sign-in carry different pseudonyms for the same
// subject, and nothing short of both keys relates them.
//
// A Signer gives the asymmetric key seals are signed with.
//
// Keys are never rotated. Rotation would break linkability across time for one
// person, which is the property the security copy is kept for. They are
// destroyed instead, and destroying one is how a subject's records become
// unlinkable: the pseudonyms remain, and nothing can recompute them.
