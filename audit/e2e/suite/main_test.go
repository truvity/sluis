// Package suite is the ONE end-to-end suite for this repository's kind
// tier: it proves the chart works against real servers, through Service
// endpoints, the way truvity/policy's own example suite does — see that
// repository's docs/audit/how-to/test-the-kind-tier.md for the pattern this one borrows.
//
// It is inert unless E2E_NAMESPACE is set, so `go test ./...` (and
// therefore `just check`) never touches a network or a cluster. Names come
// from e2e/fixture's own resolver, never repeated here by hand: a values
// file that renames a Secret or a role changes what this suite asks for
// the next time it runs, with nothing here to edit.
