// AccessRoster reads grants out of access-roster's group vocabulary.
//
// Every grant there is named `<scope>:<thing>:<role>` — role, on thing, in
// scope — and this preset reads the ones whose thing is "audit". The scope is
// "all" or an audit tenant identifier, byte for byte; an environment is not in
// the name, because each deployment's query service requires its own token
// audience and the issuer decides who may hold which, which is where the
// estate already keeps that boundary.
//
// A role grants operations over the profiles built from certain presets, so
// that a deployment's own profile names need no mention: a profile composed
// from `security` and `dora` is a security profile whatever it is called.
//
// Two roles are deliberately absent. `resolve` comes from no group name; it
// undoes the pseudonymisation and is granted by an explicit rule naming the
// person. And there is no assessor role, because a group name carries no
// dates; a time-boxed grant is an explicit rule with a window.
