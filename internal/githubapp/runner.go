//
// Private and installed only on its owner, like an organisation's App. One
// permission, `organization_self_hosted_runners: write`: what a runner
// scale set needs to register runners at organisation level, and nothing
// about members or any repository. One App per organisation per tier, so
// the key a tier's runner plane holds opens nothing in another tier. No
// webhook: a scale set asks.
//
// The name carries the tier; a long organisation login is cut, never the
// tier, so two tiers' Apps never share a name.
