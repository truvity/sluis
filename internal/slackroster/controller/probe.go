// probeGuestSides adds, to the report of the workspace that HOSTS a managed
// Slack Connect channel, the sides the guest's bot does not list. A bot lists
// a Slack Connect channel that is public on its side only sometimes, and one
// it has not joined often not at all, so a channel one workspace discovered
// can look "not listed" on another that has it. Only a channel a console
// shared-channel record manages, and whose record names this workspace as the
// host, is probed; an unmanaged one is never asked about. For such a channel,
// each connected workspace that did not list it is asked once, by id, with
// conversations.info: an answer is that side (public or private as it says,
// bot not joined), and Slack's channel_not_found (a private side the bot is
// not in) leaves the side unknown, logged at debug. When Slack names a
// connected workspace other than the host and the reporters among a
// channel's teams (host, shared, connected, pending, internal), only the
// named ones are asked. A bot is often told nothing but its own team,
// though: with no such guest named, exactly the workspaces the record names
// as sides (host and with) are asked. One call per channel per workspace per
// tick, the transport's own rate-limit retry, and a failure only logs: it
// never fails the tick.
//
// Which workspaces listed a channel is read from their last published
// reports, the host's own being the one just derived: a tick publishes its
// own report only, so a guest's side is recorded in the host's
// ([status.Workspace.GuestSides]) and the host's own side in its
// DiscoveredShared.
