// Package controller is the Slack controller: for every workspace the
// policy declares, read what Slack holds and who holds the groups the
// channels are bound to, decide, act where the workspace is enabled, and
// report.
//
// It has no listener. It reads the console's API with its own ServiceAccount
// token, writes to Slack with each workspace's bot token, writes its reports
// through the blob port, and records what it changed to the audit
// installation as its own workload. It holds nothing of the issuer's: no
// signing key, no session store, no directory credential.
//
// # Ticks
//
// The unit of work is a tick of one workspace (docs/decisions/0029), run
// under a lease on it ([Controller.RunTarget]) and publishing its own report
// and no other. A pass is a sweep of every workspace, run on the interval
// and when a credential changed; an operator's request, or the console's
// write, ticks only its workspace.
//
// # One tick
//
//  1. The inputs every workspace's tick shares are read once and kept, by the
//     policy digest and what is mounted ([Controller.inputs]): the mounted
//     credentials and the console's records (bot tokens, each installed
//     workspace's bot user id, the shared channels' definitions and the
//     console's ordinary channels, validated against the policy, the refused
//     reported, and the operators' confirmations that are still current), the
//     holders of every bound group, who is in every DIRECTORY group the
//     console channels and the shared channels name (nested groups expanded;
//     a record whose source is not a group of an allowed directory is
//     refused and reported; a directory that cannot be read fails only the
//     workspaces that depend on one), and the domains each directory serves.
//  2. The workspace: observe Slack whole, derive, ask the directory to vouch
//     for each address a removal or a leaver report rests on (one question per
//     address however many ticks name it), decide.
//  3. An enabled workspace ([rails.Switch]) carries the decision out and
//     records what became of it; every other workspace is a dry run, which
//     changes and records nothing.
//  4. A workspace that hosts a managed Slack Connect channel probes the
//     guest sides its bot does not list, reading the guests' reports
//     ([Controller.probeGuestSides]), and asks the guests to tick when it
//     invited one.
//  5. The workspace's report is published. A workspace whose tick failed
//     keeps its previous report with the failure on it, and no other
//     workspace is affected.
