// Package connection is what connecting a Slack workspace leaves behind,
// shared by the service that writes it and the controller that reads it.
//
// Two objects, for the reason the GitHub connection is two: the record and
// the credential have different readers. The RECORD (which app, in which
// Slack team once installed, owned by which directory, whose bot, connected when and by whom) is what the console
// shows. The CREDENTIAL (the app's client id and secret, and the bot token)
// is what only the controller acts with; it lives in one Secret the
// controller mounts as a volume, so the controller needs no permission to
// read Secrets through the API.
//
// A workspace passes through a state GitHub's App also has: CREATED, NOT
// INSTALLED. The console creates the Slack app from a manifest and holds the
// client id and secret, but there is no bot token until somebody approves the
// install, so the credential's BotToken and the record's BotUserID are empty
// until then. The client secret is kept afterwards, because reinstalling an
// app whose scopes grew exchanges a new OAuth code with it.
//
// Every document is one key, `<workspace>.json`, in either object. Keys
// that start with an underscore belong to other documents the console keeps
// beside them (an operator's confirmation, a flow in progress, a shared
// channel's record): a workspace key never starts with one, so no document
// can be read as a workspace's.
