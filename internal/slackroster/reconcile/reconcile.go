// Package reconcile is what the Slack controller decides, with no network
// in it: from the policy's bindings, the holders of the groups they name,
// and what one workspace holds, what its channels should contain and what
// to change to get there.
//
// It runs in two steps because removing somebody needs one more question
// than adding them. [Derive] works out everything the inputs settle and
// names the addresses the directory must be asked about; [Draft.Decide]
// finishes once each has been asked, one at a time, and removes only on an
// answer the directory vouches for ([rails.Removal]).
//
// # Who is who
//
// Workspaces are independent. A person is looked up in a workspace by their
// address in one of that workspace's domains: the address the directory
// knows them by, if it is in-domain, else another address of the same person
// from the policy's `people` table. With none, they have no account path in
// that workspace and are held, never guessed at.
//
// # Channels
//
// A channel is bound to groups; its wanted members are those groups'
// holders. It is created when absent, and otherwise adopted BY NAME: a
// visible channel with the declared name is adopted (a public one is joined,
// a private one the bot is in is managed). `adopt` names an id to
// disambiguate (a renamed channel, two candidates) and is never required.
// What is never done: converting a channel's visibility, unarchiving one, or
// creating a second channel under another name; each is held, with the
// reason.
//
// `extend` channels only add. `strict` channels (private only, enforced at
// policy load) also remove, and never touch bots or apps, the bot itself,
// deactivated users, guests, people of another workspace, anybody on the
// channel's ignore list, or anybody the directory has not vouched for. A
// removal set over half of a channel, or over half of the workspace's
// managed members, goes ahead only when an operator confirmed exactly it.
//
// # Shared channels
//
// Slack Connect channels arrive as an input list ([SharedChannel]): the
// console manages them as records, not the policy. The host creates the channel
// and invites each guest workspace's bot; a guest accepts the pending
// invitation for that channel from the host's team. Then each side invites
// only its own people: a person joins from the host when they have a
// host-domain address, otherwise from the first guest workspace, in `with`
// order, where they have one, otherwise they are held. Shared channels are
// `extend` for now.
//
// # A read that is not whole
//
// Nothing here reads "missing" as "absent": an address that was never
// looked up, a member nobody identified, is [ErrIncomplete], and the
// caller fails the workspace's pass. A workspace that could not look anybody
// up must not read as a workspace in which nobody has an account.
