// workloadBearer reads a ServiceAccount token a workload presents to the
// console as its bearer, and hands the console the account it proves.
//
// It exists for one kind of caller: a controller in the same cluster —
// the GitHub controller is the first — reading the console's API with the
// token its kubelet projected. The rule is the one
// docs/how-to/connect/service-to-service.md states for every same-cluster call:
// present the ServiceAccount token, never an exchange in front of it,
// because the issuer would verify that very token and re-sign it.
//
// The verification is the SAME set of cluster verifiers token exchange
// uses, checked against each cluster's published key set. There is no
// TokenReview here and no second list of clusters: a second place for an
// installation's trust to be configured is a second place for it to be
// wrong.
//
// What the account may then do is not decided here. It becomes a
// principal with a ServiceAccount, and the policy's `service_account`
// matchers put it in groups exactly as they do for an exchange — which
// is how an empty policy admits it to nothing.
//
// Nil when no cluster is federated: there is then nothing a workload
// could present that would verify, and a reader that refuses everything
// is better absent than consulted on every request.
