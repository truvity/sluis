// simply did not set secureCookies served its session cookie without
// the flag, and a proxy could then carry it over a plain-http hop.

// The override stays, in both directions — a TLS terminator that is not
// in the URL needs true, and a local https:// listener with a self-signed
// certificate is not the case this protects.
//
// There is no row for an unset URL: issuerURL is required, so the
// default is always decided by a scheme somebody wrote down.
