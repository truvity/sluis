// signedIn reads the issuer's own browser session and hands the console
// whoever it belongs to.
//
// This is what the merged service buys, and it is worth stating plainly
// because it removes two things at once. Before it, a console on this
// origin was authenticated either by a proxy in front of it — which ran
// an OpenID flow against an issuer in the SAME PROCESS, a network round
// trip and a second session store to learn something already known — or
// by a login of its own, which is the second door an installation with a
// gateway deliberately turns off. Now it is neither: the browser holds
// the issuer's session cookie at this host, so the console asks who it
// is.
//
// A recovery sign-in completes as a ServiceAccount rather than an
// address, and it has to survive this: recovery exists for the day
// nothing else works, and the console is where the operator then
// connects the first directory.
