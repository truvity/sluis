// Cluster verifies a Kubernetes ServiceAccount token against the key set
// its own API server publishes.
//
// This is what makes ONE issuer serve MANY clusters. The other
// way to check such a token is a TokenReview, which asks the cluster —
// and asking means holding a kubeconfig for every cluster whose workloads
// may exchange, inside the service whose whole point is to hold almost no
// credential. A key set is public: EKS publishes one per cluster (it is
// what IRSA rests on) and Talos serves the same keys at the API server's
// `/openid/v1/jwks`. So a remote cluster's workload proves itself exactly
// the way a GitHub job does, and adding a cluster is one row of
// configuration naming a URL.
//
// What is given up is TokenReview's deletion check: a token stays valid
// until it expires even if the ServiceAccount is deleted. Bound tokens
// are short-lived, so the window is minutes, and the recovery sign-in
// deliberately keeps TokenReview — on the day everything else is broken
// it should depend on nothing but the API server.
//
// The audience is the trust boundary, exactly as it is for GitHub. A
// ServiceAccount token minted for another service is a perfectly valid
// token, and accepting it here would let whatever holds it exchange for
// one of ours.
