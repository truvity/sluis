// KeyRings is every algorithm this installation signs with at once, each

// audience's chosen algorithm rather than by whatever one key happens to
// be active installation-wide: RS256 for a relying party that lags (EKS,
// Kargo — see docs/decisions/0009-a-default-signing-algorithm-and-per-audience-exceptions.md),
// ES384 for everything else, at the same time, from the same process,
// with rotating one never touching another's schedule — because each
// lives in its own [KeyRing], namespaced in the shared store by its own
// algorithm (see [keyRingIndexKey]).
//
// Built once, from the keys a deployment was given, and never grown or
// shrunk afterward: which algorithms exist is a fact about the Secrets
// this installation was handed, decided where policy and keys meet (see
// [NewStorage]), not something a running process can be told mid-flight —
// a replica that never mounted a file for a new algorithm could not
// publish its key even if told to expect one.
