// SigningKey is one key with an id, satisfying both of the library's key
// interfaces: the private half signs, the public half is published in the
// JWKS.
//
// RSA and ECDSA are both accepted, and the algorithm follows from the key
// rather than being configured beside it: an RSA key signs RS256, a P-256
// key ES256, P-384 ES384, P-521 ES512. Nothing has to declare which,
// because a key that disagreed with its declaration would produce tokens
// no relying party could verify.
//
// **The issuer does not create it.** It reads a key some other part of
// the platform put in a Secret — cert-manager issuing one, or
// external-secrets delivering one — mounted as a file. A service that
// mints its own credential is an exception to how everything else here
// gets one, and exceptions are what make an estate hard to reason about.
// It also has to be the same key in every replica and across every
// restart: one minted per process invalidates every token it signed on
// every rollout, and two replicas with two keys hand out tokens that half
// the fleet cannot verify.
//
// The id is the key's own RFC 7638 Thumbprint rather than a name given to
// it. That is what lets a key arrive from anywhere: nothing has to carry
// an id beside it, two services reading the same Secret compute the same
// one, and a key and its id cannot be separated because the id is a
// function of the key. Rotation follows from the same property — a new
// key is a new id, so the previous public key can stay in the JWKS
// without either being mistaken for the other.
//
// A single SigningKey does not decide HOW LONG the previous one stays
// published, or WHEN this one starts signing rather than merely being
// published — that is [KeyRing], which watches for a new one to appear
// and keeps the schedule every replica agrees on.
