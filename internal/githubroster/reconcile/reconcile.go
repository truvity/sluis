// Package reconcile is what the GitHub controller decides, with no network
// in it: from the policy's bindings, the holders of the groups they name,
// and what GitHub holds, what one organisation should look like and what
// to change to get there.
//
// It runs in two steps because removing somebody needs one more question
// than adding them. [Derive] works out everything the inputs settle, and
// names the addresses whose removal would rest on ABSENCE from a holders
// list — which is never evidence on its own: an unreadable workspace
// contributes no holders at all. [Decide] finishes once each of those
// addresses has been asked about one at a time, and removes only on an
// answer the directory vouches for.
//
// Who a GitHub account belongs to is what its person LINKED: they
// authorized the link App as that account, and GitHub verified the work
// addresses the link proves. GitHub discloses nothing else about a
// member's addresses outside its Enterprise Cloud plan, where the
// organisation's verified-domain addresses count as well.
//
// What is never touched, whatever the inputs: a member nobody linked
// (nobody can say who they are), a team no binding names, and an owner's
// place in the organisation. An owner is added to teams and promoted in
// them like anybody, and never removed from a team or demoted in one:
// owners are managed outside, and a break-glass seat keeps what it has. The one removal that does not ask the
// directory is an account whose link GitHub itself says is gone — the
// person removed the address, or revoked the authorization.
