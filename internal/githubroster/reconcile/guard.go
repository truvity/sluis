//     seats cannot be read: an invitation past the last seat either buys
//     one or is refused, and neither is the controller's to do.
//  3. A pass whose removals concern more than half the organisation's
//     members removes nobody, unless an operator confirmed exactly that
//     set. A policy mistake — a group renamed — looks exactly like
//     everybody leaving at once.
