// Package link is what a person linking their GitHub account leaves
// behind, shared by the service that writes a link and the controller that
// keeps checking it.
//
// A link is a GitHub account's id beside the work addresses GitHub
// verified for it, which the directory knew when the person linked. It is
// the only way a GitHub account is matched to a person on an organisation
// that GitHub does not disclose members' addresses to — every organisation
// not on its Enterprise Cloud plan.
//
// It carries the person's token pair, so the controller can ask GitHub
// again, every pass, whether those addresses are still verified on the
// account. That is why a link lives in a Secret. The pair can read one
// thing — the account's own addresses — because it is a token for the link
// App, which asks for nothing else.
