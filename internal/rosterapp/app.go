// Package rosterapp assembles the whole of sluis as ONE process:
// the directory connectors, the snapshot and its refresher, the policy,
// the OpenID provider, the login page and the console.
//
// It exists because the split into two services stopped earning its keep.
// The hub was built as a directory of record that several
// things could ask; the issuer became its only consumer, and the split
// then cost — on every single login — a ConnectRPC call, a TokenReview,
// a NetworkPolicy hop, a second store, and a class of failure where the
// two halves disagree about the same person.
//
// What this package does is wiring, and deliberately nothing else. The
// two halves are still assembled by their own packages, with their own
// decisions and their own tests; this joins them: the issuer's directory
// is a function call, the console is mounted on the issuer's origin, one
// /readyz answers for both stores, and one process runs the loops.
