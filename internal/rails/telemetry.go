// The labels are the target's KIND and ID and nothing else. A target is a
// GitHub organisation or a Slack workspace the policy declares, so the ID is
// bounded by the deployment's own declaration (a handful, not a customer
// base); it is the label an alert on "this organisation has stopped" needs, and
// the only one. A person, a group or an address is never a label or an
// attribute.
