// forwardedBearer turns a token an authenticating gateway forwarded into
// a principal, by verifying it against the issuer's published keys.
//
// The verification is [identity.Issuer] — the package this project
// publishes for its consumers — and not a copy of it. sluis uses
// the library it ships: a library its own author does not use is a
// library nobody has tested against a real listener, and every gap in it
// then surfaces first in whichever consumer is unlucky.
//
// What is left here is the part a consumer does NOT share. This service
// resolves groups from its own policy and its own directory, in process,
// so a verified token gives it an ADDRESS and the authorizer does the
// rest; a consumer reads the groups out of the token, because it has no
// policy to consult. Same verification, different question after it.
