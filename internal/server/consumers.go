// Consumers is who may call the API listener.
//
// The listener answers the two directory questions for every workspace
// this hub reads — every account, every group, every membership of every
// company it serves — so "reachable" must not be the same as "allowed".
// A NetworkPolicy is a second layer and a good one; it is not an answer
// to "which workload is this", and it is one misapplied label away from
// admitting a namespace nobody meant to.
//
// The proof is a projected ServiceAccount token with this hub's audience,
// verified by the API server. The hub therefore trusts no signature of
// its own and keeps no shared secret: it asks the cluster who is calling,
// and compares the answer to a list the deployment states.

	// Review is [kube.Client.ReviewToken]. Nil means the hub is not
	// running in a cluster and cannot check anything, which is a
	// different situation from an empty list — see [Consumers.Middleware].

	Allowed []string
	// Grants is what each admitted subject may ask, keyed the same way

	// as it did.

//
// Two situations that look alike and are not. **No reviewer** is a hub
// outside a cluster — a local run, the demonstration — where there is
// nothing to verify a token against; the listener is open and the caller
// is told so at start, loudly, because that is a development posture and
// never a deployed one. **A reviewer and an empty list** is a deployment
// that named no consumers, and it admits nobody: a hub that answered
// everyone by default would be one forgotten value away from serving a
// company's directory to the cluster.
