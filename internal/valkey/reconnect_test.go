// The property Oleg asked for, in the form of a test: a client whose
// server goes away and comes back must work again **without the process
// being restarted**.
//
// On 2026-09-10 two services dialled a Valkey address for half an hour
// after the pod behind it had moved, and a human had to restart them.
// Whether that was cluster-mode pinning or a client that never
// re-resolves is exactly what this test answers, so that "it recovers on
// its own" is a fact rather than a belief.
//
// Needs a Valkey and docker; set VALKEY_TEST_CONTAINER to the container
// name and VALKEY_TEST_ADDR to its address.

	// Non-cluster on purpose: it is what the fleet runs since this

	// CLUSTER SLOTS and talks to those, so a pod that moves takes the
	// client with it and the Service -- the one mechanism whose whole
	// job is to survive that -- is used once, as a seed, and then
	// bypassed. Here the configured address is dialled on every
	// reconnect, so a new address is simply the next dial.
