// The property a redundant store exists for, in the form of a test: a
// shard's primary dies without warning, its replica takes over, and the
// client keeps working -- **without the process being restarted and
// without anything already written being lost**.
//
// The reconnect test proves one server coming back. This one proves the
// thing a single server cannot do: a node that never comes back. It runs
// the client the way a store with more than one shard is dialled, in
// cluster mode through one seed address, and kills (SIGKILL, not a
// graceful stop: a drain hands the shard over before it exits, a dead
// node does not) the primary holding a key that was written before.
//
// Two things are asserted, and they are different promises:
//
//   - what was written before the kill is still there afterwards. A
//     session and its refresh token surviving a node loss is the whole
//     point; an empty store after a failover is a sign-in for everyone.
//   - the client answers again on its own, within a bound. Every shard
//     takes writes again, including the one that lost its primary.
//
// Needs docker and a Valkey Cluster of at least three shards with one
// replica each, every node a container. Set VALKEY_TEST_CLUSTER_ADDR to
// any node's address and VALKEY_TEST_CLUSTER_CONTAINERS to the
// comma-separated container names. The killed container is started again
// at the end, and rejoins as a replica.
