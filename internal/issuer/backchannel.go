// Back-Channel Logout tells a relying party, server to server, that a
// session it holds has ended.
//
// WHY THIS ONE, of the three optional logout mechanisms. Session
// Management and Front-Channel Logout both work by loading something
// from this origin inside the application's page -- a polled iframe, or
// one hidden iframe per client at sign-out. Browsers block third-party
// cookies by default now, so both fail quietly in exactly the case they
// exist for. This is an HTTP POST between two servers and does not care
// what a browser allows. It is also the only one that can reach a PROXY,
// which is what actually holds the session for a console with no OpenID
// flow of its own.
//
// WHAT IT BUYS. Revoking a session is immediate here and invisible
// there: a relying party holding a valid access token keeps serving
// until it next refreshes, which is up to the client's `ttl_cap`. A
// logout token closes that window instead of bounding it.
//
// OPT-IN, per client. A client that declares no `backchannel_logout_uri`
// is never contacted, so serving this changes nothing for one that has
// not asked for it.

// `sid` of which at least one must appear -- both do, because a client
