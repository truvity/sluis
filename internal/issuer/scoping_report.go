// reportGroupsScoping computes [policy.Policy.ScopeGroups] for one minted

// something, rate-limited by [groupsScopingReporter.allow]. It never
// itself changes the token: under [GroupsScopingReport] nothing else does
// either, so `groups` — held, in full — stays exactly what every caller
// of this method already put on the token; under [GroupsScopingEnforce]
// the caller has ALREADY narrowed it elsewhere (see [scopeClaims] and its
// call sites), so this only decides what to log about that, never what
// to keep.
//
// The level is the one difference between the two modes this runs under.
// [GroupsScopingReport] logs at INFO: the whole point of report mode is
// to be read before enforce is ever reached for, so the finding an
// operator needs to turn into a `groups` override belongs at a level
// nobody has to go looking for. [GroupsScopingEnforce] logs the SAME
// finding at DEBUG instead — enforcing is the steady state an
// installation runs in indefinitely, and a dropped group is no longer
// news on every one of however many tokens a busy client mints; the line
// still exists, at the level an operator turns on when a role goes
// missing and they need to see which groups a token stopped carrying,
// without paying an INFO line per finding for as long as enforce runs.
//
// A no-op under [GroupsScopingOff], and under either of the other two
// modes when audience is empty (nothing to scope by) or nothing would be
// dropped (nothing worth a line).
//
// client is the OAuth client this token is FOR, when that differs from
// audience -- an access token scoped to an RFC 8707 resource, or an
// exchange's presenting client -- and is logged alongside audience so a
// reader can tell "who asked" from "what the token is for". Empty where
// there is no separate presenting client to name (the console's own
// internal mint, [Storage.MintFor]).
