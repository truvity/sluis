// Recovery is the way in when no directory can vouch for anybody.
//
// It exists because of a deadlock that is otherwise complete. A console
// behind this issuer asks it for a token; the issuer asks the hub who the
// caller is; the hub cannot say, because no directory is connected yet;
// and the directory is connected FROM that console. Every door is locked
// from the inside, and the first installation of any deployment starts
// there.
//
// The proof is the same one the hub's own recovery takes and the same one
// this issuer already accepts from workloads: a ServiceAccount token
// minted for one audience and a few minutes, checked by the API server.
// So the authority is the cluster's RBAC -- who may mint a token for that
// account -- which is revocable by removing a binding and lands in the
// audit log.
//
// What it grants is NOT special-cased. A recovered sign-in completes as
// the ServiceAccount subject, and the policy's `service_account` matchers
// decide what that is in -- the same table, the same evaluation, the same
// audit trail as any workload. There is no bootstrap back door, only an
// identity the policy has to be told about.
