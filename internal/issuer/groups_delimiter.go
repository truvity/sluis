// applyGroupsDelimiter rewrites every `:` in each name under claims'
// `groups` entry to audience's own `groups_delimiter` -- a temporary
// interop shim for opkssh, whose server-side policy splits its argument on
// every `:` and reads only the last segment; see
// [groupsDelimiterFor] and docs/decisions/0015-a-per-audience-groups-delimiter-for-opkssh.md.
//
// It runs AFTER [scopeClaims], on whatever `groups` a token or `/userinfo`
// answer is about to carry for audience, under every [GroupsScopingMode]
// alike -- the delimiter is not a scoping decision, so it does not wait
// for [GroupsScopingEnforce] to be on, and it does not change WHICH groups
// a caller carries, only how each one's own `:` is spelled.
//
// claims is returned unchanged, not even copied, when audience names no
// `groups_delimiter` (on either the resource or the client table -- the
// overwhelming common case, every default installation and every OTHER
// audience of one that configures this at all) or carries no `groups`
// entry to rewrite. Otherwise the result is a shallow copy with `groups`
// replaced, for the same reason [scopeClaims] returns one rather than
// mutating claims in place: a caller may be holding on to the map it
// passed in for its own later use (a token exchange's cached [Grant],
// read again by [Storage.GetPrivateClaimsFromTokenExchangeRequest] and
// [Storage.SetUserinfoFromTokenExchangeRequest] alike) and must see the
// SAME rewritten map both times, never a second, independent rewrite of
// its own copy.
//
// Applying this twice on the same audience -- [Storage.issue] re-running
// it on claims an exchange already rewrote once in [Issuer.Exchange] -- is
// harmless: [policy.RewriteGroupsDelimiter] never leaves a `:` behind for
// a second pass to find, because [validGroupsDelimiter] refuses a
// delimiter that could ever contain one.
