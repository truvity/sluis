// This is the test the first attempt at the grace window did not have.
// That attempt put the window only in the minting half, which left the
// resolving half refusing the replay before the window was ever
// consulted. Every unit test passed. What changed in production was the
// wording of the refusal, from "the refresh token is not live" to
// `invalid_refresh_token`, while people went on being signed out at the
// same rate. Only a refresh driven end to end, as here, reads the token
// the way the library does.
