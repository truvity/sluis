// carrier lives under.
type signingAudienceKey struct{}

// signingAudience carries the ONE audience id this replica is about to
// sign a token for, from whichever storage hook learns it first to the
// [Storage.SigningKey] call the library makes a moment later with nothing
// but a context.
//
// It exists because zitadel/oidc v3's `Storage.SigningKey(ctx)` takes
// nothing else — see op/token.go's CreateJWT and CreateIDToken. Every
// OTHER hook this issuer implements is handed the real request and could
// read its audience directly, but the library asks for the signing key
// before most of them run, threading only a context through to get
// there. So the audience travels through this one mutable cell instead,
// on the SAME context tree every hook for one HTTP request shares:
//
//   - [withSigningAudienceContext] installs an empty one, once, before
//     the OpenID library sees the request at all.
//   - [Storage.CreateAccessToken] and [Storage.CreateAccessAndRefreshTokens]
//     mark it with the ACCESS token's audience — the request's own
//     [op.TokenRequest.GetAudience], which is already the resource a
//     caller named or the client itself, and for a token exchange the
//     GRANTED target rather than the client presenting the exchange —
//     before the library calls [Storage.SigningKey] for that token.
//   - [client.RestrictAdditionalIdTokenScopes] marks it with the ID
//     token's audience — always the client itself, never a resource —
//     which the library calls right before it calls [Storage.SigningKey]
//     for THAT token. It runs after the access token's SigningKey call
//     and before the ID token's, which is what makes overwriting the
//     SAME cell correct rather than a race: the library never asks for
//     two signing keys at once for one request.
//
// A carrier that is never marked — a path this design missed, or a test
// that builds a [Storage] directly and calls a method without going
// through [withSigningAudience] at all — reads back unset, and
// [Storage.SigningKey] then signs with the installation default. That is
// the one risk every negative test in this package exists to rule out:
// silence here looks exactly like an audience that was never meant to be
// anything special.
