// Package audit is what sluis tells the audit trail.
//
// The trail is kept by an installation of github.com/truvity/audit of this
// service's own, rendered beside it: a receiver that takes the records and
// answers RegisterCatalogue, a writer that locks and indexes them and whose
// digest job signs each hour, and
// a query service the console's Audit page reads. This package declares what
// is recorded in a catalogue (catalogue/roster.yaml), registers it at
// start-up, and sends each record to the receiver. With no installation
// configured, nothing is kept beyond the log line every record also is.
//
// The vocabulary is fixed here and nowhere else. Every action has one
// constructor in events.go, the catalogue declares every one of them, and the
// gate fails when the two disagree; a caller cannot invent an action, a
// target type or an actor kind.
//
// Recording never fails the thing being recorded, with one deliberate
// exception. A sign-in that could not be written down still happened, and
// refusing it because the trail was slow would turn an audit outage into an
// access outage. So almost every action is delivered `async`: it waits in the
// emitter's own queue, in memory, and is retried until the receiver
// acknowledges it. A recovery sign-in bypasses the directory, so its catalogue
// entry says `block`: [Trail.RecordDurable] returns only once the installation
// has it, and the caller refuses the sign-in when it does not.
