// Package hublocal asks the directory about a person by CALLING it.
//
// It is the network client this package replaced, with the
// network taken out: the same question, the same vocabulary, the same
// distinction between "the directory says no" and "I could not ask". The
// split that made the network version necessary — one deployment holding
// every corporate credential, another minting tokens — stopped earning
// its keep when the issuer became the directory's only consumer.
// What it cost was paid on every single login: a ConnectRPC
// call, a TokenReview, a NetworkPolicy hop, and a class of failure where
// the two halves disagree.
