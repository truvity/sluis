// Two names, because the flows are different in the way that matters:
// consent is an operator granting this hub access to a company, sign-in
// is a person proving who they are. One cookie would let a callback
// finish a flow the browser did not start.
//
// A third for a person linking a GitHub account, for the same reason: an
// operator connecting an organisation in one tab and linking their own
// account in another must not have either flow finish the other.
//
// A fourth for a recovery form, which shared the sign-in's at first: the
// issuer and a console mounted on its host both set it, so opening any
// sign-in page -- either one's, or a provider button on it -- replaced the
// state a recovery form already open in another tab was bound to, and a
// cookie holding a recovery state could be presented to a provider
// callback, and the other way round. Its own name keeps each flow's state
