// Package identity turns a token somebody else issued into the caller a
// listener acts on.
//
// It is the consumer half of sluis: a service behind the gateway
// imports this, points it at the issuer, and gets back who is calling
// and which internal groups they are in. There is no group re-mapping
// anywhere in it — the name in the policy is the name in the token is
// the name in the role check — because a second vocabulary is a second
// place for access to mean something different.
//
// Two anchors, and a handler never learns which one proved the caller.
// [Issuer] verifies a token this installation's issuer signed, for
// anything further away than the next pod. [Cluster] verifies a
// Kubernetes ServiceAccount token for a workload in the same cluster.
// Both yield [Verified], so a handler cannot come to depend on the
// distinction — which matters, because the right anchor is decided by
// how far away the caller is and that can change without the handler.
//
// sluis uses this package itself rather than keeping a copy of
// it. A library its own author does not use is a library nobody has
// tested against a real listener.
