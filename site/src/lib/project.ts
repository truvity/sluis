// The v2 project board, read once per build (ADR 0020) with src/lib/board.ts. The status
// page groups by the options of its `Product milestone` field, so a new or reordered
// option changes the page with no code change; the Worker reads the same board live.
//
// The token is GH_TOKEN or GITHUB_TOKEN from the environment, tried in that order; it is
// sent only to api.github.com and never logged. Reading an organisation's project needs a
// token with that permission: a workstation's `gh auth token` has it, the GITHUB_TOKEN of
// GitHub Actions does not. Without one the build does not fail: it says so in one log line,
// and the page shows that the project data was not available at build time.
