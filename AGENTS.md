# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI agents working in this repository. People follow the same rules, written in [docs/contributing/](docs/contributing.md); this file is their short form. If it disagrees with a page there, the page wins.

## Every task

- v2 is the orphan branch `main`; v1 is `master`. A fresh clone checks out `master`: switch to `origin/main` first. Never branch from, target or push to `master` for v2 work, and never push to `main`.
- One change, one worktree, in your own scratch area and never inside someone else's checkout: check `git remote -v`, then `git worktree add --no-track -b <type>/<short-name> <dir> origin/main`. Push with an explicit refspec: `git push origin <branch>:<branch>`.
- Your shell may reset its working directory between calls. Use absolute paths: `git -C <abs>`, or `cd <abs> && <cmd>` in one call.
- Tools come from devbox. Run the `just` recipe, not the bare tool: `devbox run -- just check` is the gate. No testcontainers; prefer pinned release binaries.
- This repository is public: no real organisation account, hostname, ticket, secret path or person other than the maintainer. Use the example names in `docs/contributing/public-content.md`.
- Never print a secret or a token: not in output, logs, commits or pull request text.
- The maintainer decides. Present options with pros, cons and a recommendation; do not pick. Merge only as the "Merging" section of `docs/contributing/workflow.md` allows.
- If a safety check or a permission prompt blocks you, stop and report; do not work around it.
- Merging is by rebase only. Do not force-push and do not stack pull requests: rebuild a pull request on the new `main` instead. Merge with `--match-head-commit <sha>`, never `--admin`, after you have read every review-bot thread; then check the runs on `main`, the Site deploy included.
- Write at most a couple of issues yourself; every other issue, comment, label or board change goes into a script the maintainer runs (`.claude/skills/maintainer-script/SKILL.md`).

## How we design

The full method is `docs/contributing/design.md`. In short:

- Principles first: check the question against `docs/principles.md` and the accepted ADRs, and write the answer when they settle it.
- Ask the maintainer only real conflicts (two principles pull apart, a principle does not reach, a fact nobody here can know), each with options, pros and cons, and a recommendation.
- Generalise before detail: list the high-level questions of a milestone or topic first, then map issues and records under them.
- Record the roads not taken, with the reason. Label claims READ, MEASURED or UNVERIFIED, and date them.
- Nothing without a consumer: it arrives with its first real caller; until then it is a planned line and an issue.
- State each rule once, in a record or a reference page, and link to it. Records are rewritable until the first release (keep `docs/decisions/renumbered.json`) and append-only after.
- Keep records, requirements, the roadmap and the issues in step. Milestones are an order: first working version, v1 parity, CIAM upstream, quota.

## Keys, roots and ceremonies

- Roots and ceremonies (root keys, root transitions, keyrings, trust bundles, the ceremony CLI) live in the separate project ritueel: https://github.com/truvity/ritueel and https://ritueel.id. sluis holds intermediates only.
- Keys are generated in place, on a card or in a cloud key service, and are never extractable.
- sluis has no two-person ceremonies, no air-gapped live CD and no YubiHSM in its design.
- The source of truth is `docs/decisions/0013-the-hand-off-to-root-custody-and-the-signing-api.md` (ADR 0013, "Intermediates and the hand-off to root custody").
