# Keys: what they are for, how many, where they live

**Pseudonymisation keys are off by default.** `keys.provider: none` is what a
deployment runs unless it says otherwise: no key directory, no login to a
secret manager, no `identity/` prefix, and resolve refused as unimplemented.
Most installations need none of it, because the identifiers they record are
already opaque and the staff they record are meant to be readable
([0055](../../decisions/0055-no-pseudonymisation-keys-by-default.md)). Such a
deployment declares `external_identifiers_are_opaque` instead, and skips
everything on this page about pseudonymisation.

Everything below about pseudonymisation keys applies to **a deployment that
must be able to crypto-shred**: one whose contract demands erasure of an
identifier from a locked archive, or whose records unavoidably carry direct
identifiers. That is a deliberate choice, made once and recorded by the
deployer, and it cannot be undone or migrated afterwards.

The **signing key is different**: it is for seals
([0061](../../decisions/0061-seals.md)): the notary signs each closed hour with it. It does not depend on what the deployment does about pseudonyms.
[Signing key](#signing-key) is that half of the page.

| kind | what it does | how many | who holds it | ends by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **pseudonymisation** (symmetric), off by default | turns an identifier into a stable pseudonym; seals the identity behind it | one per **tenant × purpose**, created on first use | the writer (make), resolve (open) | destruction — that is erasure |
| **signing** (asymmetric), for seals | signs the seals | one per installation | the signer only, never the writer | replacement, with the old public half kept |

Neither is ever rotated, and that is deliberate.

## Why keys at all

The archive is write-once under Object Lock, for years. Two things follow.

- A person can lawfully ask to be forgotten, and some profiles must not hold
  a directly identifying name in the first place. Nothing in the archive can
  be deleted or edited, so where a record does carry such a name, the only
  way to honour that is to write something that **can be made meaningless
  later**: a pseudonym under a key, and destroy the key. Where the
  identifier was opaque to begin with there is nothing to make meaningless,
  which is why the default is no keys at all.
- Object Lock stops deletion. It does not prove the trail is complete and
  genuine to anyone outside: a record can be added beside the real ones, a
  quiet hour cannot be told from an emptied one, and a copy (an export, a
  replica, a restored backup) carries no lock at all. **Seals** will prove all
  three, to anyone with the public key. Until they are built, `audit verify`
  checks the per-object `sha256` and per-record hashes, which needs no key.

## Pseudonymisation keys

### The requirement

- The **same person, same tenant, same purpose** always gets the same
  pseudonym, for the whole retention: that is what lets an investigation
  follow one actor through years of records.
- The **same person under two purposes** gets two unrelated pseudonyms. The
  security copy and the billing copy of one event cannot be joined on a
  person, which digital-identity regulation requires of a wallet provider.
- Nobody without the key can compute, check or reverse a pseudonym. A plain
  hash fails this: hash every e-mail you know and compare.
- Destroying one tenant's key for one purpose erases exactly that tenant's
  people in that purpose, and nothing else.
- The way back (resolve) exists for the cases the law requires, is available
  to almost nobody, is itself recorded, and dies with the key.

So the key model is **one key per (tenant, purpose)**, where a purpose is a
profile's name. A deployment with two profiles and a thousand tenants has two
thousand keys. They are created on first use — the first record for a tenant
in a profile — never in advance.

### How a key is used

For a record whose profile says an actor kind is pseudonymised:

    pseudonym = "ps_" + base64url( HMAC-SHA256( key[tenant, purpose], identifier ) )

The identifier is what the emitter sent (`alice@example.com`, a user id).
The writer replaces it with the pseudonym in that profile's copy. Other
profiles that keep the kind in clear keep the identifier.

For resolve, the writer also **seals** the identifier under the same key
(AES-GCM, with a sealing key derived from the data key so one key never
serves two algorithms) and stores the sealed form in the archive beside the
records, at `identity/tenant=<t>/purpose=<p>/<pseudonym>`. Opening it needs
the same key. A deployment that wants no way back turns this off
(`ForgetIdentities` / `--keep-identities=false`).

### Never rotated

Rotating a pseudonymisation key would give every person a second, unrelated
pseudonym from the rotation on, and break the one property the security copy
is kept for. The threat rotation answers (a leaked key) is answered here by
where the key lives (below), not by changing it.

### Destroyed, and the tombstone

`audit key destroy --tenant <t> --purpose <p> --by <who> --reason <why>`
is erasure. It refuses while a legal hold covers the tenant, and refuses
without a writer to record `audit.key.destroyed` through: an erasure the
trail does not mention is one nobody can prove was lawful.

After it, the pseudonyms in the archive stay, and nothing can ever compute
or match them again, and every sealed identity is unreadable. The provider
leaves a **tombstone** — a marker that the key existed and is gone — so that
a later record for the same tenant does not quietly mint a fresh key and hand
the same person a new identity. The marker is checked before any key is
created.

### Where the keys live: three providers

**`local`.** Each data key is 32 random bytes, generated by the writer,
wrapped (AES-GCM) under a 32-byte **root** the deployment supplies in a
Secret, named by `keys.local.rootFile`, and stored as a file in the directory
`keys.local.dir`. The root never leaves the
Secret; the directory holds only wrapped keys and tombstones. Two writers
sharing one directory agree (create-once via link, so a race mints one key,
not two); two writers with separate directories do **not**, and the writer
refuses that. Losing the directory is losing every tenant's pseudonyms
silently, so the chart's `keysVolume` is what holds it, and a replica count
above one without `keys.local.dir` is refused. It is right for tests and
for a single instance; a production deployment should want one of the
other two.

**`transit` (OpenBAO or Vault).** There is no root and no directory. Each
(tenant, purpose) is a **key inside the transit engine**, named
`<prefix>.<purpose>.<tenant>`, created by the writer on first use through
the encrypt endpoint. The key material never leaves the engine: a pseudonym
is the engine's HMAC of the identifier under that key, a seal is the
engine's encryption, both pinned to the key's first version. What OpenBAO
adds, concretely:

- **No shared state between replicas.** Every writer asks the same engine,
  so any number of replicas agree without a shared volume.
- **Nothing to back up or lose.** The keys are in the engine's storage,
  covered by its own snapshots and DR.
- **Scope by policy, per role.** The engine's policy decides who may do what
  with which purposes: the writer may `hmac` and `encrypt` on its purposes
  and touch nothing under `transit/keys`; the query service's resolve role
  may `decrypt` and nothing else; a metering role gets its purpose only;
  only a human eraser role reaches `rotate`, `config` and `trim`. A leaked
  writer credential can make pseudonyms and cannot open or erase any.
- **No stored credential.** The writer signs in with the pod's projected
  service-account token on a JWT auth mount, so there is no long-lived
  token to leak or rotate.
- **Erasure as a tombstone the engine keeps.** Destroy rotates the key
  once, raises the minimum usable version past the first, and trims the
  first version away. The key remains, unusable for anything written under
  it, and cannot be re-created; a tenant destroyed before it was ever seen
  gets a key made and destroyed at once.

The full engine set-up and the policies per role are in
[OpenBAO keys](../how-to/configure-openbao-keys.md).

**`kms` (AWS KMS envelope).** One customer-managed
KMS key per deployment is the root. Each (tenant, purpose) data key is
minted by `GenerateDataKey` with an encryption context naming the tenant and
purpose, and the wrapped copy is stored in a key table (the index database)
beside a tombstone column. The writer unwraps into memory on first use; a
processor's IAM role is scoped by the encryption context to the purposes it
may unwrap. It is the same model as `local` with KMS as the root and a
database as the directory, and it is the choice for a deployment with no
OpenBAO. Not a single KMS key with derived children: KMS cannot HMAC per
tenant without a key per tenant, and per-tenant KMS keys would cost and
count in the thousands.

### Which one

- Anything that does not have to crypto-shred: `none`, the default.
- Tests, a laptop, a single-instance trial that does: `local`.
- Anything with more than one replica, or where secrets already live in
  OpenBAO: `transit`.
- A deployment on AWS with no OpenBAO: `kms`. The KMS key provider (`keys.adapter: kms`) is built and runs in a pod through the SDK's default credential chain: it signs the notary's seals, and, with `keys.state.backend: database`, it pseudonymises with the per-tenant secrets wrapped under the KMS key and kept in your PostgreSQL, so it needs no SSM.
- The key options for a deployment are, then, KMS (AWS) or OpenBao transit; the seals use either today (below).

The choice is permanent for a deployment. Moving keys between providers
would mean either re-keying every tenant (a new identity for every person)
or exporting key material, which two of the three providers exist to make
impossible.

## Signing key

### The requirement

A seal ([0061](../../decisions/0061-seals.md)) is signed ES384, with a **P-384**
key, by the notary (`audit-notary`), which runs hourly. The v0 digest job and
its ed25519 and P-256 keys were removed with the v0 layout.

The signing key must be one the **writer cannot use**. Whoever can write the
archive and also sign for it can choose what to sign. So the notary has its
own identity and its own credentials, and the writer's have no path to the key;
the chart refuses a notary that runs as the writer (the same ServiceAccount, the
same cloud role annotations, or the same OpenBAO role).

### Where it lives

- **AWS KMS** (`ECC_NIST_P384`, `SIGN_VERIFY`) is the one to use on AWS. The
  private half never leaves KMS. Create it once, outside the chart:

  ```sh
  aws kms create-key --key-spec ECC_NIST_P384 --key-usage SIGN_VERIFY \
    --description "audit seals"
  aws kms create-alias --alias-name alias/audit-seal --target-key-id <key id>
  ```

  The notary signs a SHA-384 digest (`MessageType DIGEST`, `ECDSA_SHA_384`), so
  the signing input can be any size. Its role needs `kms:Sign` and
  `kms:GetPublicKey` on that key and nothing else of KMS; the writer's role
  needs neither, and the key policy should say so rather than rely on what an
  IAM policy omits. Every signature is in KMS's own log, and CloudTrail's
  `Sign` events against the key are the independent record of when the notary
  signed. A key of another spec is refused at start, before anything is signed.
- **OpenBAO transit** (`ecdsa-p384`): the same separation for a deployment
  whose secrets live in OpenBAO. The notary's policy may `update` on
  `transit/sign/<key>` and `read` on `transit/keys/<key>`; the writer's may not.
  `bao write transit/keys/audit-seal type=ecdsa-p384`.
- **A key file** (a P-384 private key in PEM, PKCS#8 or SEC 1, from a Secret):
  for development, and for a deployment that accepts that the private half is in
  the cluster beside the archive's credentials. It proves the objects have not
  changed since they were sealed, and not that the operator did not choose what
  to seal.

`audit key public --kms-key alias/audit-seal --thumbprint` prints the RFC 7638
thumbprint a verifier pins, and `--jwks` the JWK Set that goes in
`keys/roots.jwks`; the default is the PEM. The notary writes
`keys/roots.jwks` itself, once, if the bucket has none; if the bucket has one
that does not list the notary's key, it refuses to sign, because the file is the
operator's.

### Trust is the pin, not the bucket

An auditor believes a key because **they pinned its thumbprint**, which they
took from you out of band (the output of `audit key public --thumbprint`, in
their contract or their configuration), and not because the key is in the
bucket. `keys/roots.jwks` and everything under `keys/` is distribution. A
verifier ignores a key that is not pinned, so someone with write access to the
bucket cannot add a root. Give the thumbprint to every verifier, and tell them
before it changes.

### Delegation

A root can delegate: a statement, signed by the root, that another key may sign
seals for some profiles and tenants for at most 25 hours, which a notary then
holds in place of the root, renewed daily, with the root offline or in a
hardware module. `audit verify` already checks them: the window, the scope,
the 25-hour limit, a revocation by a root from a time, and that no root but a
pinned one counts. **The notary does not take a delegation yet**: it signs with
the key it is given, which must be listed in `keys/roots.jwks` as a root, so
the KMS key above is the root today, and the day it is a delegate is a change
to the notary and not to the contract.

### Replaced, not rotated

A signing key can be replaced. A seal names its key by thumbprint, so seals
made by the old key still verify as long as the verifier pins the old
thumbprint as well as the new one. What must never happen is losing a public
half: keep every one that ever signed, beside the archive, for as long as the
archive lives, and keep every verifier's pins for as long as there are seals
under them. Replacing the key does not break the chain: `prev` is a hash of the
previous seal's bytes, whoever signed it.

## Identities on the platform

On Kubernetes the cloud identity of a component is its ServiceAccount (Pod
Identity, IRSA), so the chart gives every component one of its own, bindable
separately through `serviceAccount`, `receiver.serviceAccount`,
`query.serviceAccount` and `jobs.*.serviceAccount`. This is what keeps the
separations above true on a cluster: the receiver publishes and holds neither
the bucket nor a key, so it must not run as the writer, and in stream mode the
chart refuses a receiver and a writer that share a ServiceAccount name.

## What a deployment supplies

| provider | Secret or engine | rights |
|---|---|---|
| `none` (default) | nothing | — |
| `local` | a 32-byte root in a Secret; a persistent, shared directory | — |
| `transit` | an OpenBAO transit mount in the environment's namespace; a JWT role per component | writer: `hmac`, `encrypt` on its purposes; resolve: `decrypt`; eraser (human): `read`, `update` on `transit/keys/<prefix>.*` |
| signing, KMS (for seals) | one asymmetric key | the signer: `kms:Sign`, `kms:GetPublicKey` |
| signing, transit (for seals) | one `ecdsa-p384` transit key | the signer: `transit/sign/<key>`, `read` on the key |
