# Stream mode

The receiver publishes to a JetStream stream and acknowledges when the
stream says the record is replicated. Writers are separate pods that consume
the stream and put the objects; the indexer follows the bucket. Nothing in the application's
request path waits for S3.

This is the shape for a product: many application pods, a record rate that
makes batching worth having, a metering profile, and — if quotas are wanted
— a second consumer of the same stream.

## What it looks like

```mermaid

  subgraph ns["the application's namespace"]
    subgraph APP["application pods"]
      E["emit"]
    end
    R["receiver ×2"]
    NATS[("JetStream<br/>the application's account")]
    W["writer ×N<br/>consumer mode"]
    U["usage consumer ×1<br/>quotas only"]
    Q["audit-query ×2"]
    PG[("the application's Postgres<br/>database audit:<br/>index, cursors, dedupe, rollups")]
    VK[("cache<br/>quotas only")]
    CJ["CronJobs<br/>verify, purge, clock-sync"]
    ST["statement CronJob<br/>billing only, monthly"]
    E --> R --> NATS
    NATS --> W --> PG
    NATS --> U --> VK
    Q --> PG
    ST --> PG
  end
  S3[("the environment's bucket<br/>audit/app/")]
  W --> S3
  Q --> S3
  CJ --> S3
  ST --> S3
  CONS["the application's console"] -- "its own token" --> Q
```

The stream is a buffer with a bounded horizon, not a store: the record
becomes durable evidence when the writer puts the object. What the stream
buys is that the application is never waiting for S3, that a writer rollout
becomes a backlog rather than a hole, and that a second consumer can read
the same records for something else.

## One record

A billable action, declared `block` because it will appear on an invoice:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as the caller
  participant A as an application pod
  participant R as receiver
  participant N as JetStream
  participant W as writer
  participant S3 as bucket
  participant PG as database
  participant O as indexer

  C->>A: an operation that is billed
  A->>A: validate, the record carries meter quantity 1
  A->>R: Record, block
  R->>N: publish
  N-->>R: acknowledged, replicated
  R-->>A: durable
  A-->>C: result
  N->>W: a batch, moments later
  W->>S3: put the security copy and the billing copy
  W->>PG: dedupe by id
  W-->>N: acknowledge the batch
  O->>S3: list from the cursor, once the object is past the settle window
  O->>PG: rows, facet counts, rollup per tenant, meter and hour, and the cursor
```

The writer acknowledges to the stream only after the objects are in the
bucket, so a writer that dies mid-batch causes a redelivery and the dedupe
table absorbs it.

It also gathers before it writes. Fetching from a stream returns whatever is
there, and writing each fetch straight through would make an object of each; an
archive of many small objects costs a request to put, an entry in every listing,
forever. So the writer accumulates until one of three is reached —
`roll.maxRecords`, the roller's byte limit, or `roll.interval` — and writes
once. Nothing waits on this but the object: the records are already durable on
the stream, and they stay unacknowledged until the put, so a writer that dies
mid-window leaves them for the next one.

`stream.ackWait` must therefore exceed `roll.interval` plus the longest a put
can take. The writer refuses to start otherwise, because a stream that gives up
waiting sooner offers the same records to a second writer and the day's objects
quietly double.

## Who the query service trusts

In this shape the console is usually behind a gateway that issues its own
token, so the page calls the query service directly with the token the
person's session already has. The query service lists that issuer and
audience in its grants, and the grants decide which profiles and tenants the
person may read.

An application whose console keeps a session of its own instead — a cookie,
not a gateway token — reaches the query service through the console, which
mints a short token per person. Both are described in
[integrating](../how-to/connect-an-application.md#the-audit-page).

## Scaling

Receivers scale with the application's request rate, writers with the record rate and the
number of profiles, and the stream is sized for the longest writer outage you want to
survive. The values and the rest are in
[run the chart in stream mode](../how-to/run-stream-mode.md).
