# Go module `github.com/truvity/sluis`

What a Go service behind the gateway imports. The shape follows
[../design/trust.md](../explanation/trust.md): **exactly two verifiers**, one
per anchor, and one `Verified` whichever proved the caller — so a handler
never learns which anchor answered and cannot come to depend on it.

sluis uses this itself rather than keeping a copy. A library its
own author does not use is a library nobody has tested against a real
listener.

```go
import (
    "github.com/truvity/sluis/identity"
    "github.com/truvity/sluis/policy"
    "github.com/truvity/sluis/tokens"
)
```

## Rendering an installation's documents — `config`

```go
import "github.com/truvity/sluis/config"

in, err := config.LoadInstallation("installation.yaml")
service, policy, err := config.Render(in)   // sluis.yaml and policy.yaml, as bytes
```

The public configuration package: the document types of the service document (v3) and
the policy document (v2), `Load` and `Validate` against the authored schemas, and the
[installation](configuration.md#the-installation-document), the typed input an estate
writes once. `Render` is deterministic and holds both outputs to the loader the service
runs at start; it is what `sluisctl render` and the Pulumi library
(`LambdaArgs.Installation`) call, so no estate hand-renders the documents
([0038](../decisions/0038-estates-render-through-sluis.md)). `config.InstallationSchema()`
is the authored schema of the installation. A program that is not sluis never imports
`internal/config`.

## An MCP server's own side — `identity/resource`

```go
res, _ := resource.New(resource.Config{IssuerURL: "https://access.example", ResourceURL: "https://mcp.example.com/metrics", Scope: "openid"})
mux.Handle(res.Path(), res.Metadata())
mux.Handle("/", res.Protect(mcp))
```

`Protect` verifies the bearer for the resource's own URL and answers the
RFC 9728 challenge; `Metadata` serves the Protected Resource Metadata.
[connect/mcp.md](../how-to/connect/mcp.md#a-go-server-identityresource) is the
guide, and `resource-proxy` is the same thing as a sidecar for a server
you did not write.

## A console behind a proxy that forwards a bearer — the issuer anchor

The proxy in front — gateway-native OIDC, `access-proxy` (deprecated,
Envoy Gateway only), or a hand-run `oauth2-proxy` on any other gateway —
makes no difference here: whichever one it is, the module reads whatever
forwards a verified bearer.

```go
issuer := &identity.Issuer{
    URL:      "https://access.example",
    Audience: "roster.example",   // this console's client id at the issuer
}

mux := http.NewServeMux()
mux.Handle(identity.WhoAmIPath, identity.WhoAmI(version))
mux.Handle("/admin/", identity.Require("all:roster:operator")(admin))

http.ListenAndServe(":8080", identity.Middleware(issuer)(mux))
```

**A struct rather than a constructor, and no context.** A service must
start whether or not the issuer is reachable, and an issuer that is down
must not be a service that will not boot. Discovery is lazy and cached:
the first request after the issuer returns is the one that pays for it,
and the key set refetches itself when a signature names a key it has not
seen, which makes rotation a non-event.

**`Middleware` establishes; `Require` refuses.** They are separate
because a listener serves pages that run before anybody is established —
a health endpoint, a login page, a landing page — and a middleware that
refused for them is one every such route has to be excluded from. Wrap
everything in `Middleware`, and put `Require` on the routes that need it.
`Require` with no group means *any caller this installation vouches for*,
which is a real posture where the issuer's `requires` is already the gate.

A refusal never names the group that would have worked: a caller learning
which group opens a door has learned something it had no way to ask.

## A service on the cluster network — the cluster anchor

For a workload calling a service in the **same** cluster. Anything
further away exchanges its token at the issuer first and arrives as an
ordinary bearer.

```go
cluster := &identity.Cluster{
    Review:   kube.ReviewToken,          // yours, or client-go's
    Audience: "the-service",
    Name:     "prod",
    Groups:   []string{"prod:k8s:admin"},
}

http.ListenAndServe(":8080", identity.Middleware(cluster, issuer)(mux))
```

**`Review` is supplied, not built.** Otherwise every consumer that only
needs the issuer would inherit Kubernetes client libraries for a code
path it never runs.

**`Groups` is stated by the listener**, because a TokenReview says *who*
and never *what they may do* — the policy is not reachable from here. A
token the issuer signed carries its groups; a ServiceAccount token does
not.

Several verifiers are tried in order and the first that answers wins. A
verifier that could not **reach** the issuer stops the chain rather than
falling through, because trying the next one would turn an outage into
*your token is bad* and send a legitimate caller to authenticate again,
repeatedly.

## What it never does

**No group re-mapping, anywhere.** The name in the policy is the name in
the token is the name in the role check. A second vocabulary is a second
place for access to mean something different.

**No token parsing in a browser.** That is the TypeScript package's rule
and this one's corollary: the browser asks the application, and the
application answers from what it verified.

## Exchange, and the two credential shapes

```go
exchanger := &tokens.Exchanger{Issuer: "https://access.example", ClientID: "local-dev"}
token, err := exchanger.Exchange(ctx, subject, tokens.TypeJWT, "aws:111122223333:power")
```

`TypeJWT` labels a proof from outside — a GitHub job's token, a
ServiceAccount token. A sign-in of this issuer's own is presented as
`tokens.TypeAccessToken`, and only the access token of a live session at
a `public` client declaring `sign_in_exchange: true`, presented by that
client, is taken; an ID token, or any other token this issuer signs, is
refused. The client is presented in **HTTP Basic**: the issuer reads an
exchange's client from Basic alone and never from a posted `client_id`,
so getting that wrong is refused as *invalid client* — an error about
the client rather than about the mistake. A refusal comes back as
`tokens.ErrRefused`, carrying the issuer's own sentence, which names the
audience and the groups the proof holds.

A GitHub App installation token of a catalogue App is the same exchange
with the App named instead of an audience, narrowed by repositories and
permissions:

```go
exchanger := &tokens.Exchanger{Issuer: "https://access.example", ClientID: "github-app:publisher"}
minted, err := exchanger.GitHubInstallationToken(ctx, subject, tokens.TypeJWT, "publisher",
	[]string{"app"}, map[string]string{"contents": "read"})
// minted.AccessToken, minted.Expires, and what GitHub granted: minted.Repositories, minted.Permissions
```

It asks for `tokens.TypeGitHubInstallationToken`, and a refusal is
`tokens.ErrRefused` in the same way
([contract](contracts.md#installation-tokens-at-token)).

```go
tokens.WriteExecCredential(os.Stdout, apiVersion, token)   // kubectl reads this
creds, _ := tokens.AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity(ctx, nil, roleARN, who, token.AccessToken)
tokens.WriteCredentialProcess(os.Stdout, creds)            // the AWS SDKs read this
```

`AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` is **unsigned**, which is why the AWS path
needs no stored key: the token is the proof, and the account's trust
policy decides what it opens.

## Policy

```go
declared, _ := policy.LoadDeclared("/etc/sluis/policy")  // a file or a directory
set, _ := policy.NewSet(declared)                                // validated once, at load

result := set.Evaluate(policy.Input{
    Email:           "alice@example.com",
    DirectoryGroups: groups,      // what the directory confirmed
    Authoritative:   true,        // and whether that answer may be acted on
})
```

The same `Input` carries the other two proofs: `GitHub` — repository,
owner, ref, workflow, environment, visibility, as the job's token says —
and `ServiceAccount` — cluster, namespace, name. A person, a CI job and
a workload are the same evaluation against the same matchers.

`policy.Policy` also carries the `slack` and `people` tables.
`Set.SlackWorkspaceDeclared(key)` and `Set.SlackWorkspaceKeys()` say which Slack
workspaces the policy names; `Policy.PeopleByAddress()` maps every listed
address to its person; `Set.Declared()` returns the declared policy, read-only,
for a caller that validates a definition of its own against it (a console
channel record). `LoadDeclared` refuses `team_id`, `domains` and `owner` under a
Slack workspace and `owner` under a GitHub organisation, with a message saying
where each now comes from.

One layer. There was a second that a console could write; it is gone,
because a console that can disagree with git is a second
source of truth and a merge to reconcile them.

## Not built yet

`authz` (role helpers over `Verified`), `directory` (a client for the
endpoint that returns when something needs it again), and the adapters
for fiber, gRPC and connect. Each is additive: they sit on the same
`Verified` and change nothing above.
