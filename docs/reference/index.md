These pages fix the shapes a developer needs before writing code for the [first working version](/roadmap/): the names, fields, formats and codes that the decision records leave to a spec. A decision record says why; a page here says exactly what. When a page and a [decision record](/decisions/) disagree, the record is the reasoning and the page is fixed.

| Page | What it fixes |
|---|---|
| [Actor registry](/reference/actors/) | Every actor: language, placement, keys and slots, ports, governing ADRs, requirement areas, standards, issue label |
| [Commands](/reference/cli/) | The `sluis` command tree of the first working version, its flags, its JSON output and its exit codes |
| [Install file](/reference/install-file/) | The install-file schema v1, and the example file of the local installation |
| [Contracts and errors](/reference/contracts/) | How `proto/` is written and versioned, which services are public, and the error model |
| [Storage](/reference/storage/) | The port contracts, the record kinds of the first working version, the state envelope and the on-disk layout of the local drivers |
| [Approved libraries](/reference/approved-libraries/) | The cryptography and parser libraries each language may use |

The permission manifest, which generates the enforcement, is on [Architecture](/architecture/manifest/).

Each page marks a point that still needs the maintainer as a proposed note that links its issue. Everything else on these pages is decided.
