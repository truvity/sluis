# Capabilities

What each platform can do today and what is designed. The [architecture](../../concepts/audit/architecture.md) explains the parts; decisions [0058](../../decisions/0058-three-parts-installed-independently.md) to [0066](../../decisions/0066-indexer-and-query-are-separate-processes.md) set the direction.

| mark | means |
|---|---|
| 📄 designed | described in a decision or reference page; no code |
| 🧪 built | the code exists and is tested; not yet run live |
| ✅ supported | built, tested in CI and run in an installation |
| n/a | does not apply to that platform |

The ingest path, notary and cursor observe write and read the v1 layout (🧪). The rest of the target architecture is 📄. Only the previous release's CLI (v0.6.x) reads the v0 archive.

## Ingest

| `/readyz` beside `/healthz` on the writer, query service and indexer; the chart's readiness probes read it | ✅ | n/a | 📄 |
| `event=unknown_catalogue` and `audit_writer_catalogue_unknown_total` for a record naming a catalogue version the writer lacks, and the `<name>-writer-unknown-catalogue` alarm | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |

| metrics over OTLP: acknowledgements by durability, write latency per transport, index lag, consumer failures | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |

| traces over OTLP: server and client spans, `traceparent` across NATS headers and SQS attributes, no personal data on a span | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |
| chart `renders: alerts`: nine alert rules as a `VMRule` or `PrometheusRule`, unit-tested on vmalert-tool | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |
| chart `renders: dashboards`: the audit overview for Grafana's sidecar, held to the observability dashboard lint | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |

The `s3` sink works against any S3-compatible store. Without Object Lock it is the `attested` tier ([0056](../../decisions/0056-lock-modes-and-store-tiers.md)).

## The archive

| feature | Kubernetes | AWS | self-hosted |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1 layout, written and read ([bucket contract](bucket-contract.md)): one object per ingest batch, keyed by ingest time | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |
| `catalogue/<app>/<version>`, written once, compared when present | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |
| `audit verify`: key, metadata, sha256 and per-record hashes of every object | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |
| `audit verify --root`: the seals of a range, against pinned roots (below) | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |
| Object Lock, compliance mode | ✅ | ✅ | n/a |
| governance trial, then compliance ([0065](../../decisions/0065-archive-retention-and-lifecycle.md)); the Pulumi library takes `NONE`, `GOVERNANCE` or `COMPLIANCE` | 📄 | 🧪 | n/a |
| lifecycle to Glacier Instant Retrieval and Deep Archive (a rule per profile prefix in the Pulumi library) | n/a | 🧪 | n/a |
| bucket-contract conformance suite (records, catalogue and ordering, against the memory store and S3) | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |
| conformance of seals, delegation and revocation: against the memory store and S3, with a key file and a KMS P-384 key (LocalStack) | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |

## Notary

Seals ([0061](../../decisions/0061-seals.md)) come from `audit-notary`, a binary and image of its own.

| feature | Kubernetes | AWS | self-hosted |
|---|---|---|---|
| seals, chained through `prev`, one per profile, tenant and hour, empty hours too; settle window; idempotent; refuses to seal what does not match its metadata | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |
| Merkle root over per-record hashes (RFC 6962), inclusion proofs and the vectors for n = 0, 1, 2, 3 and 5 (`internal/merkle`) | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |
| `keys/roots.jwks`, written once; thumbprints pinned by the verifier | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |
| chart: `jobs.notary`, an hourly CronJob under an identity of its own, refused if it is the writer's | 🧪 | n/a | n/a |
| seal age: `audit.seal.age`, the `AuditSealStale` alert and a dashboard panel | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |
| verifying a delegation (window, scope, 25 hours) and a revocation | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |
| signing a delegation: a notary on a short-lived delegated key (decision L3: daily) | 📄 | 📄 | 📄 |
| signer: AWS KMS `ECC_NIST_P384` | 🧪 | 🧪 | n/a |
| signer: OpenBAO transit `ecdsa-p384` | 🧪 | n/a | 🧪 |
| signer: P-384 key file | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |
| signer: PKCS#11 | n/a | n/a | 📄 |
| signer: TPM | n/a | n/a | 📄 |
| notary as a function on an EventBridge Scheduler schedule (`audit-notary-lambda`) | n/a | 🧪 | n/a |
| `audit verify` of seals: signature, chain, count and root against the objects, missing seals | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |

Seals are tested against the in-memory store and LocalStack S3, signed by a key file and a KMS key. No installation has run them, so none is ✅. The ed25519 and P-256 signers still sign and verify in `keys`, and sign no seal.

## Observe

| feature | Kubernetes | AWS | self-hosted |
|---|---|---|---|
| index and search on Postgres | ✅ | 📄 | 📄 |
| cursor observe: `audit-observe` lists the bucket from a durable cursor per profile and tenant, behind a settle window ([0062](../../decisions/0062-observe-follows-the-bucket.md)) | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |
| notifications as a wake-up (a NATS subject or an SQS queue that only shortens the poll) | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |
| one database role per part: the writer's has no index, observe's writes it, the query service's reads it ([0066](../../decisions/0066-indexer-and-query-are-separate-processes.md)) | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |
| reindex from the archive (v1), and a cursor reset | 🧪 | 🧪 | 🧪 |
| usage quotas | 📄 | 📄 | 📄 |
| billing statements | 📄 | 📄 | 📄 |

## Packaging

| Pulumi library (bucket with Object Lock and lifecycle, keys, queue and DLQ, functions, roles, schedule, alarms, a cross-account read role; `deploy/pulumi`, mocks only) | n/a | 🧪 | n/a |
| CloudWatch alarm set: throttles, DLQ not empty, oldest message age, errors, unknown catalogue version, notary silence, to SNS and alert-ingress | n/a | 🧪 | n/a |
