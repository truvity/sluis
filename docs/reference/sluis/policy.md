```

`memberships` is refused as unknown. Name a directory group in a group's `members`.

## Layers

The policy is one file or a directory of `*.yaml` files, each `version: 1`. `sluisctl policy render` merges them ([rendering](policy-document.md#rendering)). Validation runs once on the result ([policy-validation.md](policy-validation.md)).

| Table | Merge across files |
|---|---|
| `groups`, `claims`, `lifetimes`, `clients`, `resources`, `github.<org>.teams`, `people` | by key; a key declared twice is refused |
| `vocabulary`, `client_documents` | one file declares each; a second is refused |
| `slack` workspaces | field by field; a channel comes from one file |
| `github.<org>.members` | one file; `ignore` entries add up |

A file with an `access` key is an access document ([policy-bindings.md](policy-bindings.md#the-access-document)).

## Naming

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<scope>:<thing>:<role>` | a grant; grammar in [taxonomy.md](taxonomy.md) |
| `rung:<name>` | a session lifetime |
| `emp:<slug>` | a person |

Others warn.

## Claims

Merge rules: [policy-groups.md](policy-groups.md#groups-to-token-by-deep-merge).

## Vocabulary

Optional scopes, things and role ladders: [policy-vocabulary.md](policy-vocabulary.md). Write one: [declare a vocabulary](../../guides/sluis/declare-a-vocabulary.md).

<a id="resources--what-a-token-is-for"></a>

## Resources: what a token is for

A client names a resource with `resource` (RFC 8707). The caller meets both `requires`; the shorter `ttl_cap` wins.

| decided in | [policy concepts](../../concepts/sluis/policy.md#why-a-resource-is-not-a-client) |

## Agent-class clients

`session: agent` marks software that holds its own refresh token. Lifetimes: `lifetimes.agent` in [configuration.md](configuration.md).

| decided in | [sessions](../../concepts/sluis/sessions.md#agent-class-sessions) |

## Groups in a token (scoping)

`groupsScoping` is `off`, `report` or `enforce`; the default is `report`.

| Mode | Token groups |
|---|---|
| `off` | all held groups |
| `report` | all held groups; logs what `enforce` would drop |
| `enforce` | held groups whose `<scope>:<thing>` pair is in the audience's `requires`, plus the `groups:` override (`all`, a list of things, `rung`, `emp`) |

`requires` and lifetimes read the full set. See [override](policy-clients.md#groups-override), [rule](../../concepts/sluis/groups-in-a-token.md), [read the report](../../guides/sluis/read-the-groups-scoping-report.md), [turn enforce on](../../guides/sluis/turn-enforce-on.md).

## Groups delimiter (per audience, opkssh interop)

`groups_delimiter` replaces every `:` in the audience's `groups` claim.

| use | [connect SSH](../../guides/sluis/connect/ssh.md) |
| decided in | [policy concepts](../../concepts/sluis/policy.md#why-a-groups-delimiter-exists) |

## Signing algorithm per audience

`signing_alg` pins RS256, ES256 or ES384. The default is ES384 in the chart. A pin with no key is refused at start.

| decided in | [policy concepts](../../concepts/sluis/policy.md#why-an-audience-can-pin-a-signing-algorithm) |

## Clients that describe themselves

`client_documents` admits an HTTPS `client_id` from an allow-listed origin. Off unless `origins` is set.

## Keys

<!-- generated: policy-keys -->

Source: `schemas/config/policy.schema.json`. Generated by `just docs-generate`; keys are listed with their parents first.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apiVersion` | any | **required** | Which version of which document this is. sluis.truvity.github.io/policy/v2 is what this build writes; a document with no apiVersion is v1, which the binary converts as it loads it, and a binary reads v2 and v1 (docs/reference/sluis/configuration.md). |
| `apps` | object | — | What an operator may make on the console. |
| `apps.github` | object | — | GitHub Apps. |
| `apps.github.apps` | array | — | Every GitHub App the installation declares, of every purpose: the link App, the catalogue Apps and the runner tiers (docs/guides/sluis/connect/github-apps-catalogue.md). A grant naming an undeclared group stops the service. |
| `apps.github.apps[].description` | string | — | What it is for. |
| `apps.github.apps[].events` | array | — | Webhook events the App subscribes to. They are delivered only to an App that declares a `webhook`. |
| `apps.github.apps[].export` | boolean | — | Place the installed App's key at `external/github/<id>` for a consumer to read. Unset keeps it internal. A runner App is always exported. |
| `apps.github.apps[].grants` | array | — | Who may ask for tokens of it, and for how much. |
| `apps.github.apps[].grants[].group` | string | **required** | The internal group. |
| `apps.github.apps[].grants[].permissions` | object | **required** | Permission name to level: read, write or admin. |
| `apps.github.apps[].grants[].permissions.<name>` | one of read, write, admin | — |  |
| `apps.github.apps[].grants[].repositories` | array | **required** | Repository globs. |
| `apps.github.apps[].id` | string | — | The App's key in storage, unique, never changes. `link` for the link App; for a catalogue App [a-z0-9-], at most 32, not beginning `runner-`; a runner entry may leave it out (`runner-<tier>`, and `runner-<tier>-<org>` with an `org`). |
| `apps.github.apps[].installation` | one of all, selected | — | all or selected (default). |
| `apps.github.apps[].labels` | object | — | At most 16 short lower-case labels, key to value, kept on the App's record for a reader that selects Apps by them. |
| `apps.github.apps[].labels.<name>` | string | — |  |
| `apps.github.apps[].name` | string | — | Default <org>-<id>. |
| `apps.github.apps[].org` | string | — | The organisation a catalogue App is created under (required for it), or the only organisation of a runner entry (no `org` offers the tier in every organisation). The link App's owner. |
| `apps.github.apps[].permissions` | object | — | Permission name to level: read, write or admin. |
| `apps.github.apps[].permissions.<name>` | one of read, write, admin | — |  |
| `apps.github.apps[].public` | boolean | — | Installable by other organisations. |
| `apps.github.apps[].purpose` | one of link, catalogue, runner | **required** | What the App is for: `link` is the App that links a person's GitHub account, `catalogue` an App an operator creates and installs from the console, `runner` the tier an operator may create a runner App for. |
| `apps.github.apps[].tier` | string | — | A runner entry's tier: lower-case letters, digits and dashes, at most 16. |
| `apps.github.apps[].webhook` | object | — | Where GitHub delivers the App's events: exactly one of `url` and `kargo`. Needs non-empty `events`; set `export: true` so a consumer can read the secret. The secret is generated by this service, set on GitHub right after the App is created, and kept at `external/github/<id>` as `webhook_secret`; it is rotated from the console, without overlap (docs/decisions/0041). An App created before this is declared cannot be switched to a webhook: GitHub has no API for that, so disconnect it and create it again. |
| `apps.github.apps[].webhook.kargo` | object | — | A Kargo GitHub receiver. Kargo derives the receiver's path from its secret (`/github/<hex sha256(project + receiver + secret)>`), so the URL moves whenever the secret does. |
| `apps.github.apps[].webhook.kargo.base` | string | **required** | Where Kargo's receivers are served. |

| `apps.slack` | object | — | Slack Apps. |
| `apps.slack.catalogue` | array | — | Every Slack App the installation declares (docs/guides/sluis/connect/slack-apps-catalogue.md). One for a workspace the policy does not declare stops the service. |
| `apps.slack.catalogue[].botScopes` | array | **required** | The bot scopes. |
| `apps.slack.catalogue[].description` | string | — | At most 140. |
