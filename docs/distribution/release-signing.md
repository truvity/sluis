Releases before the roots exist carry checksums, SBOMs, GitHub build-provenance attestations and keyless cosign signatures on images, all made by the CI build with no stored key. Nothing is signed with a sluis key or with OpenPGP until [ritueel](https://ritueel.id) has held the root ceremony and its drill, because a signature that a later root does not vouch for teaches users to trust a key that is then thrown away. From then on, releases are signed through sluis's own signing API with a release subkey held in a cloud key service: detached signatures first, then signed apt and dnf metadata at the parity milestone ([ADR 0013](/decisions/0013-the-hand-off-to-root-custody-and-the-signing-api/#signed-releases), [ADR 0019](/decisions/0019-release-train-packaging-and-distribution/#signing-and-checksums)).

## What a release carries

| From | What | Verified with |
|---|---|---|
| The first release | A `.sha256` per file and a `SHA256SUMS` for the release | `sha256sum`, against the copy on GitHub Releases |
| The first release | GitHub build provenance attestations for every artifact and image digest, and SBOM attestations bound to them | `gh attestation verify` |
| The first release | An SPDX JSON SBOM per archive and per image, made by syft | Any SPDX reader |
| The first release | A keyless cosign signature on each image digest | `cosign verify` |
| The roots exist | `SHA256SUMS.asc`, a detached ASCII-armoured OpenPGP signature over `SHA256SUMS` | `gpgv` or `sqv` with the release keyring |
| The parity milestone | Signed apt metadata (`InRelease`, `Release.gpg`) and dnf metadata (`repomd.xml.asc`) ([#1074](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1074)) | apt with `signed-by`, dnf with `repo_gpgcheck=1` |
| Later | A header signature on each rpm package | dnf with `gpgcheck=1` |

R2 serves the files and GitHub Releases is the immutable record; when they differ, the release is right. A provenance attestation says which workflow built a file. It is GitHub's statement, not a signature by a sluis key.

Sigstore says how a file was built, not who vouches for it: its trust rests on GitHub's OIDC identity and the public Sigstore instance, so it does not replace the OpenPGP release key ([ADR 0019](/decisions/0019-release-train-packaging-and-distribution/#signing-and-checksums)). GHCR has no OCI referrers API, so the attestations and signatures of an image are found through the fallback tag `sha256-<digest>`; a registry mirror must copy those tags too.

## How to verify

### A single file

```sh
# Example
sha256sum -c sluis_linux_arm64.tar.gz.sha256
```

This catches a damaged download. It doesn't prove who made the file, because the `.sha256` comes from the same place.

### A release, before it is signed

Take `SHA256SUMS` from the GitHub release, check each file against it, and check the provenance:

```sh
# Example
gh release download v2.0.0 --repo truvity/sluis --pattern SHA256SUMS
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
gh attestation verify sluis_linux_arm64.tar.gz --repo truvity/sluis
```

The attestation pins the repository, so a file built by any other repository's workflow fails.

### A release, once it is signed

```sh
# Example
gpgv --keyring ./sluis-release-keyring.gpg SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
```

There is one signature file, and it verifies against the keyring.

### apt and dnf packages

From the parity milestone the package manager verifies the repository for you ([Packages](/distribution/packages/)).

- **apt** verifies `InRelease` (or `Release` with `Release.gpg`) against the keyring named by `signed-by`. A `NO_PUBKEY` or `BADSIG` error means the keyring or the metadata is not the one you set up.
- **dnf** verifies the metadata with `repo_gpgcheck=1`, and the metadata carries each package's checksum.

Refresh the keyring package when a repository starts failing after a subkey's expiry date.

### Images and charts

Use the digest, not a tag, and check the provenance:

```sh
# Example
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/truvity/sluis/actor-entry@sha256:<digest> --repo truvity/sluis
```

A Helm chart pins its images by digest, so verifying the chart and installing it gives the images released with it.

## The OpenPGP release key

The OpenPGP key is a dedicated sluis release identity, not anyone's personal key.

- **The primaries are ritueel's.** There are two primary keys, one on each root card, used only at ritueel's yearly ceremony. They are redundancy, not two-person control. How they are made and kept is taught at [ritueel.id](https://ritueel.id/concepts/openpgp-release-keys/); sluis holds no primary and runs no ceremony.
- **A release subkey does the work.** For sluis's own releases it is held in a cloud key service and bound by a root primary, and CI reaches it through the signing API, so a release needs no card work. It lasts about 13 months; each year a new binding over the same subkey extends its expiry, and sluis warns 60, 30 and 14 days before. The subkey itself changes only on an event or after three years at most ([ADR 0012](/decisions/0012-cryptography-and-authority-keys/#rotation)).
- **Users verify with the keyring package,** which carries both primaries and every current subkey binding. A verifier that holds only one primary cannot check a subkey that the other bound. The keyring package is built with ritueel's tools and published in sluis's own apt and dnf repositories.
- **A subkey is revoked by the primary of the year.** A revoked subkey is dropped from the next keyring package, and its revocation signature is still published.
- **Finding the key.** The primaries' fingerprints are published on the project site and in the repository's `SECURITY.md`; compare them on both before you trust a keyring. Further channels (keys.openpgp.org, a Web Key Directory, DNS `OPENPGPKEY` records) and the verification tools to document are ritueel's research: [truvity/ritueel#28](https://github.com/truvity/ritueel/issues/28).

### How releases are signed

sluis signs as a service. CI proves its GitHub OIDC identity to the signing API, policy decides which repository, branch or workflow may use which key, sluis signs in place and records the signature in the audit log, and the key is never shown. CI holds no release signing key of its own. The project's releases are the API's first user; its contract is [ADR 0029](/decisions/0029-the-signing-api-signs-sent-content-for-an-authorised-proof-and-returns-an-armoured-detached-signature/), and the release work is [#874](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/874). A file too large to send is covered by its checksum, and the checksum file is what is signed.

### What verifiers need

Measured on 2026-10-29 and 2026-10-31 with `gpg` and `gpgv` 2.2.27 to 2.4.8, `sqv` 1.1.0 to 1.5.0, apt 2.4 to 3.0 and rpm 6.0 (rpm-sequoia): every verifier accepts ECDSA P-384 signatures on version 4 keys.

- **`gpgv` needs a binary keyring.** It cannot read an armoured file. apt takes either a binary `.gpg` or an armoured `.asc` in `Signed-By`.
- **rpm imports armoured keys only.**
- **apt's `Release.gpg` must be armoured.** A binary detached signature fails with `NODATA` (apt 2.4, checked again on 2026-10-31).

## How CI uploads

CI has no static upload key and no release signing key.

1. The release workflow gets a GitHub OIDC token.
2. It exchanges that token with sluis.
3. sluis mints a short-lived Cloudflare R2 token scoped to the distribution bucket.
4. CI uploads the files with that token, and the token expires.

Only the workflow identity that the policy names can obtain the token, so a fork or a pull request can't publish.

## What a check does not prove

- A checksum taken from the same place as the file proves only that the download is whole. Take `SHA256SUMS` from the GitHub release, a second place.
- A signature shows who published the file and that it wasn't changed. It doesn't show that the code is free of bugs.
- The release subkey signs without a person present. If the signing API is compromised during the subkey's validity, a bad file can be signed. The primaries limit that to the subkey's life, and revoking the subkey ends it. The provenance attestation and the immutable release are independent checks that don't depend on the subkey.
- A new install trusts the keyring it first sees. Compare the fingerprints on a second channel.
