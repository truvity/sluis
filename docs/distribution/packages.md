A sluis release publishes every artifact from `https://distribution.sluis.id/`, a Cloudflare R2 bucket, with no redirects. GitHub Releases holds the same files as the immutable record. Every artifact of a release carries the same version and ships together. The design is [ADR 0019](/decisions/0019-release-train-packaging-and-distribution/); how to check what you downloaded is [Release signing](/distribution/release-signing/).

## Supported platforms

| Distribution | Version | systemd | Packages from |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ubuntu | 26.04 LTS | 259 | the apt repository |
| Rocky Linux | the latest stable, 10.x | 257 (10.2) | the dnf repository |
| Amazon Linux | 2023 | 252 | the dnf repository |

- **All of them on amd64 and arm64.**
- **The systemd floor is 252,** the version in Amazon Linux 2023. Generated units may rely on what 252 provides, such as `LoadCredentialEncrypted=` and `ExecPaths=`.
- **Serverless and Kubernetes have no host distribution.** An executable that needs cgo is built against the oldest supported glibc, so the same binary runs in a package and in an image.
- **A board image older than the floor is a declared exception,** not a supported platform: its units use plain `LoadCredential=` where `LoadCredentialEncrypted=` is missing, and `sluis doctor` warns where its kernel fails the randomness checklist. The exception ends when board images for the supported distributions exist ([#881](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/881)). Key material is never affected: it stays in the card.
- **No FIPS build in v2.0.** Every platform gets the same build, and the algorithms stay in the FIPS-approved set so that a variant can be added when a customer needs it ([ADR 0012](/decisions/0012-cryptography-and-authority-keys/#algorithms), [Keys](/concepts/keys/)).

## Packaging per runtime

There are no build profiles: the runtime decides the packaging, and every artifact is built for amd64 and arm64. `dev` is not a build; it is the local installation, which runs the published images under Docker Compose.

| Runtime | Packaging |
|---|---|
| [bare-metal](/runtimes/bare-metal/) | `.deb` and `.rpm` packages split by function, in apt and dnf repositories, and a tarball |
| [serverless](/runtimes/serverless/) | A zip per executable, a function per actor instance, at most three sluis layers per function |
| [kubernetes](/runtimes/kubernetes/) | One multi-arch OCI image per process, and one Helm chart with the images pinned by digest |

The install directory is the same in a package, a tarball and an image:

```text
/usr/libexec/sluis/{actors,drivers,integrations,node,vendor}/<short-name>
```

## Packages by function

Every driver executable is a package of its own, so a host installs only what it runs.

| Package | Holds |
|---|---|
| `sluis` | The CLI, `sluis agent`, `sluis trust sync` with its timer ([Identity](/concepts/identity/)), and `sluis key request`, `install` and `status` |
| `sluis-node` | The node agent |
| `sluis-server` | The core actors and the first-party integrations |
| `sluis-driver-<name>` | One driver executable, with the system packages it needs |
| `sluis-audit-writer` | The audit writer and the witness |
| `sluis-audit-search` | The indexer and the reader |
| `sluis-quota` | The quota engine |
| `sluis-host` | The root host service, mainly for [SSH](/integrations/ssh/); it never listens on the network |
| `sluis-console` | The console's static bundle |
| `sluis-install-boards` | The meta-package of the boards installation |

Examples of driver packages:

| Package | Dependencies and contents |
|---|---|
| `sluis-driver-yubikey-piv` | Depends on pcscd and pcsc-lite. On a node the card service serves `key-holder` only ([ADR 0012](/decisions/0012-cryptography-and-authority-keys/#exclusive-card-access)) |
| `sluis-driver-rqlite` | Ships `rqlited` under `vendor/` and the `sluis-rqlite@.service` template |
| `sluis-driver-aws` | The one Rust `aws` driver executable |

- **`sluis-server`, the audit packages and `sluis-quota` depend on no driver package,** so a host that runs only the audit log or only Quota installs neither the core actors nor an unused driver.
- **Meta-packages exist only for the bare-metal installations that install from packages.** The local installation runs images and uses software keys by default, so it needs no package and no driver package.
- **Template units only.** The packages ship `sluis-<actor>@.service` and `sluis-<actor>@.socket` and a systemd generator that reads `/etc/sluis/install.yaml` and creates the instances ([Bare-metal](/runtimes/bare-metal/)). sluis generates no per-installation packages.
- **The console is a separate artifact,** a bundle of static files built once per release and served on the same origin as the API: a directory from `sluis-console` on bare-metal, the bucket behind the API gateway on serverless, its own Deployment on Kubernetes. The audit console is a bundle of its own on the same train, served on the audit front's origin ([ADR 0015](/decisions/0015-audit-pieces-transport-search-and-front/), [#985](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/985)).
- **Root ceremonies are not part of sluis.** They belong to [ritueel](https://ritueel.id). The release keyring package that apt and dnf verify with is built with ritueel's tools and published in sluis's own repositories, once the roots exist ([Release signing](/distribution/release-signing/#the-openpgp-release-key)).

## The R2 layout

```text
apt/       dists/stable/{InRelease,Release,Release.gpg}
           dists/stable/main/binary-{amd64,arm64}/
           pool/
dnf/       {x86_64,aarch64}/{repodata/, packages}
           sluis.repo
bin/       <version>/<component>_linux_{amd64,arm64}.tar.gz
lambda/    <version>/{functions,layers,extensions}/sluis-<kind>-<name>_<version>_{arm64,x86_64}.zip
checksums/ <version>/SHA256SUMS, and SHA256SUMS.asc once releases are signed
keys/      the release keyring, once the roots exist
oidc/      nodes/<node>/.well-known/openid-configuration, jwks.json
latest     pointer to the newest version
```

- The repository metadata files (`InRelease`, `Release.gpg`, `repomd.xml.asc`) are signed from the parity milestone on; until then a repository cannot be verified by its signature.
- `oidc/` is not a release artifact. It holds workload-identity discovery documents and key sets, public keys only, for a fleet that chooses per-node issuers; by default workload tokens come from the boundary's issuer ([Identity](/concepts/identity/)).
- `latest` points to the newest version. Pin a version in anything you automate.

## apt (Debian and Ubuntu)

Until releases are signed, download the `.deb` files and `SHA256SUMS` from the GitHub release and check them, as the [tutorial](/tutorials/single-node-install/) does. Once the apt metadata is signed, add the repository with the release keyring:

```sh
# Example
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/sluis-release.gpg] https://distribution.sluis.id/apt stable main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sluis.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install sluis
```

The repository has one suite, `stable`, and one component, `main`. `signed-by` scopes the keyring to this one repository. How you get the keyring and check it is in [Release signing](/distribution/release-signing/#the-openpgp-release-key).

## dnf (Rocky Linux and Amazon Linux)

```ini
# Example: /etc/yum.repos.d/sluis.repo
[sluis]
name=sluis
baseurl=https://distribution.sluis.id/dnf/$basearch
enabled=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgcheck=0
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/sluis-release.asc
```

`$basearch` is `x86_64` or `aarch64`. `repo_gpgcheck=1` verifies the signed `repomd.xml`, which carries each package's checksum. Header signatures on each rpm come later ([ADR 0013](/decisions/0013-the-hand-off-to-root-custody-and-the-signing-api/#the-signing-api)); then the file sets `gpgcheck=1` as well. Before the metadata is signed, verify downloaded `.rpm` files against `SHA256SUMS`.

## Binaries

Each component is a tarball per architecture at `bin/<version>/<component>_linux_{amd64,arm64}.tar.gz`, with its `.sha256` beside it, laid out like a package. Use a tarball when you manage the units yourself.

## Lambda zips

The zips are under `lambda/<version>/` for `arm64`, the default, and `x86_64`, named `sluis-<kind>-<name>_<version>_<arch>.zip` on R2 and in the GitHub release alike.

- `functions/`: one zip per executable; the handler is the package's binary, renamed `bootstrap`.
- `layers/`: at most three sluis layers: the edge layer (with the vendored Lambda Web Adapter that only `entry` uses), the drivers layer and the configuration layer, so two of Lambda's five stay free for the operator.
- `extensions/`: one Rust `aws` driver executable per function, implementing every AWS port it needs.

An installation verifies the zips and publishes the layers into its own account; sluis publishes no public layer ARNs. The YubiKey driver, `key-holder`, `sluis-node`, rqlite and every driver that needs a disk or a long-running process are not published for Lambda ([Serverless](/runtimes/serverless/)).

## OCI images

One image per process, so a container can run its one executable only. Multi-arch images are on GHCR as `ghcr.io/truvity/sluis/<kind>/<name>` (if GHCR refuses three-segment names, `ghcr.io/truvity/sluis/<kind>-<name>`, [#876](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/876)). The tag is the release version; pull by digest.

- The base is distroless `static`, or distroless with glibc and a pinned `pcsc-lite` for a cgo executable.
- The executable sits at the package's path, byte for byte, and a label names its source package. A release test compares the images' binaries with the packages' files by hash.
- One image set serves the local installation and Kubernetes.

```sh
# Example
docker pull ghcr.io/truvity/sluis/actors/entry@sha256:<digest>
```

## Helm charts

Charts are OCI artifacts under `ghcr.io/truvity/sluis/charts/`, and a chart's version is the release version. A chart pins every image by digest, so it installs exactly the images released with it.

- **One `sluis` chart** with a piece selector and the presets `install`, `audit-install`, `quota-install` and `kubernetes-dev`, and no subcharts, so a writer and a reader always come from one release. The console runs as its own Deployment behind the same route as `entry`.
- **The cert-manager issuer** has a chart of its own, with its CRDs and RBAC. The certificate sidecar is an image plus a documented container snippet.

```sh
# Example
helm pull oci://ghcr.io/truvity/sluis/charts/sluis --version <version>
```

## GitHub Releases

GitHub Releases is the immutable record. Each release holds the same files as the R2 version directory, with the GitHub build provenance attestations. If a file on R2 and a file on the release differ, the release is right.

## Compatibility

All artifacts of one version are compatible with each other, and only with each other. Between releases, compatibility follows semantic versioning ([ADR 0019](/decisions/0019-release-train-packaging-and-distribution/#compatibility-between-releases), [#1022](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1022)).
