A claim of conformance is only worth what the test behind it is worth. sluis claims a profile only when a published test suite passes it, keeps the proof in the repository, and runs the suite often enough that the claim stays true. The standards themselves are in the [register](/standards/). The umbrella issue is [#850](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/850).

## Which plans v2 targets

The plan names are the OpenID Foundation's; the exact plan identifiers are confirmed against the current suite release before the work on each starts. v2 keeps parity with v1 on the first four.

| Plan | What it covers | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Config OP | The discovery document and the key set | First wave |
| Basic OP | The code flow with PKCE, the ID token, UserInfo and refresh, for static client registration with discovery | First wave |
| RP-Initiated Logout OP | `end_session`, `id_token_hint`, post-logout redirects; every logout submission must include it | First wave |
| Back-Channel Logout OP | The signed logout token, its two-minute expiry and no `nonce` | First wave |
| Form Post OP | `response_mode=form_post` for the code flow; the auto-submit page has a strict CSP with a per-response nonce | Second wave, in the same pipeline ([#979](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/979)) |
| WebAuthn, with a browser virtual authenticator and a software authenticator library | The passkey ceremony | With passkeys ([#885](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/885)) |
| Relying-party plans (Basic RP, Config RP and the logout RP plans that apply) | sluis as a client of an upstream provider, through the [generic OIDC upstream](/integrations/oidc-upstream/) | Later ([#930](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/930)) |
| FAPI 2.0 Security Profile (Final) OP | The sender-constrained variants sluis supports (DPoP; mutual TLS only if added); needs PAR, `private_key_jwt`, DPoP, RFC 9207 and, for some variants, JAR | After the parity milestone ([#929](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/929)) |
| FAPI 2.0 Message Signing OP | Signed requests and responses, on top of the Security Profile | After the parity milestone ([#929](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/929)) |
| CIBA, poll mode | Approval with a passkey on the approving device | Later: after the parity milestone, once a real consumer exists ([#980](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/980)) |

The optional plans follow [ADR 0006](/decisions/0006-identity-issuers-audiences-and-sign-in/).

### The plans sluis does not claim

Users and auditors should not infer support from silence. These are not planned unless a decision changes them:

| Plan | Why not |
|---|---|
| Implicit OP and Hybrid OP | The implicit and hybrid response types are not served; code with PKCE replaces them. |
| Dynamic OP | Dynamic client registration is refused; Client ID Metadata Documents admit self-describing clients from allow-listed origins. |
| Session Management OP | A browser iframe mechanism. |
| Front-Channel Logout OP | Hidden iframes depend on third-party cookies, which browsers block. Back-channel logout is the path, and discovery does not advertise front-channel logout. |
| 3rd Party-Initiated Login OP | A sign-in starts at the client. Revisited if the console gets an app launcher. |
| FAPI 1.0 Advanced | Superseded by FAPI 2.0. |

A suite module may skip because the discovery document says a feature is not served. That is the intended outcome: **discovery is truthful**, and a skip is acceptable only when discovery explains it.

## How the tests run in CI

Conformance is a pipeline, not a ritual, because a run done by hand rots. The pipeline is [#931](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/931), part of the first working version.

- **The suite** is a self-hosted instance of the open-source OpenID Foundation conformance suite.
- **Against the installations.** Each plan runs against the [local](/runtimes/installations/#local) installation and the [lambda](/runtimes/installations/#lambda) installation, through the [installation test harness](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/877). The cloud installation runs only in a restricted private runner group with no pull-request trigger ([#891](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/891)).
- **When.** On pull requests that touch protocol code, against the local installation; nightly and on every release, the full set against the lambda installation. A change that breaks a claimed plan fails CI.
- **The inputs.** sluis holds no accounts, even in tests. The harness signs people in through a real identity provider, Keycloak in a container on every pull request, and nightly against two free cloud tenants: Google Cloud Identity Free and Microsoft Entra ID Free ([ADR 0018](/decisions/0018-runtimes-installations-and-delivery-order/#the-local-installation)), and the harness clients and that provider's realm are declared in a reviewed file. Passkeys are tested with a browser's virtual authenticator and a software authenticator library. The product carries no test code: the server under test is the released build, and only configuration differs.
- **The outputs.** Logs and result bundles are archived per release. Result exports hold client secrets, so what is published is the plan, the variant, the version and the counts.
- **The attended steps.** Some modules end at a page the suite cannot judge, such as an error page the issuer must show. The pipeline either compares the page automatically or hands it to a reviewer; which, is settled in [#931](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/931).

## What certification means, and when

Passing the suite on your own and **certification** are different things. In the OpenID Foundation's certification programme an implementer submits the suite's results for a **specific version** and **profile**, with a statement, and the Foundation lists the implementation as certified for it. A logout submission must include RP-Initiated Logout plus one other logout profile.

Certification is not a security audit, not a FIPS validation (sluis v2.0 has no FIPS build; see the [register](/standards/#crypto-and-compliance)), and not a promise about the next release. An external penetration test and a certification are conditions for calling a customer-identity profile production-ready.

The submission package and the self-certification statement are assembled by a script from a release's archived results, so a submission is a by-product of a release, not a separate project.

:::note[Proposed]
Certification comes after v2 passes the first-wave plans in CI on a tagged release, and not before v2 reaches parity with v1; there is no date ([#931](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/931)). FAPI 2.0 certification follows when PAR, DPoP and `private_key_jwt` ship ([#929](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/929)).

## Conformance beyond OpenID

OpenID plans cover the protocol surface. Other suites cover what sits underneath.

- **The port conformance suite** ([#851](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/851)). Every driver of every [port](/concepts/drivers/) passes one shared behavioural suite, in `kits/conformance`, per driver and per kit language (Go, Rust and TypeScript). A new driver, or a fork's, is accepted when it passes.
- **The kits' conformance vectors** ([#861](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/861)). The shared kits exist in Go, Rust and TypeScript: the ConnectRPC server and client over Unix sockets with peer credentials, the configuration loader and validator, and the command-line shape. One set of vectors runs against all three, including which documents are valid under the generated JSON Schema ([Configuration](/concepts/configuration/)).
- **Minters.** A shared test for every credential-minter integration: create a credential, use it, let it expire, and sweep.
- **Policy tests** ([#852](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/852)) for the grant naming, the matchers and the lifetimes.
- **The isolation vectors** ([#950](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/950)). Every control of the [threat model](/security/threat-model/) has vectors in the [isolation area](/requirements/iso/) of the requirements catalogue. Each is an attempt that must fail at a named layer while the harness switches the other layers off. A vector that is refused even with every layer off is void, so a passing run proves each layer on its own.
- **The deny matrix.** The permission manifest generates tests that prove an actor cannot do what its manifest does not say ([Architecture](/architecture/)).

## How much of the catalogue an external suite checks

The [requirements catalogue](/requirements/) says, for each requirement, how it is verified. A requirement is **externally checked** when its verification includes a published conformance suite or a set of test vectors, rather than only a test of sluis's own or a manual review. The requirements lint computes the figures below from the catalogue and fails when they are stale.

<!-- coverage:begin (generated by site/scripts/check-requirements.mjs with its write-coverage flag; do not edit) -->
| Requirements | Externally checked | Share |
|---|---|---|
| All, not withdrawn (795) | 208 | 26.2% |
| MUST (749) | 193 | 25.8% |
