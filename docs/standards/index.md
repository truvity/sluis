title: Standards register
description: The RFCs, specifications and standards sluis v2 uses or plans to, grouped by area, with what each is used for and where it stands.
status: target
sidebar:
  order: 0
---

This is the register of the standards sluis builds on. Each row says which standard, what sluis uses it for, and where it stands in v2. How conformance is proved is on [Conformance](/standards/conformance/).

## How to read the status

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Target in v2** | Part of the v2 design, in one of the product milestones ([Roadmap](/roadmap/)). |
| **Planned** | Intended, with an issue, but its role or design is not settled yet. |
| **Later** | Deliberately after the parity milestone, or until a named trigger or consumer. |
| **Not planned** | Deliberately not served. A row changes only by a decision. |
| **Reference only** | A document that informs a choice. sluis makes no claim of conformance to it. |

Every row is tied to a feature or a stated use, or says plainly that it is not planned or reference only. Issue numbers link to [github.com/truvity/sluis/issues](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues).

## PKI and certificates

| Identifier | Title | What sluis uses it for | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [RFC 5280](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280) | X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile | The `ca` actor's certificates; the public keys in KMS are exported as SubjectPublicKeyInfo; roots are pinned by SPKI hash. | Target in v2 ([#913](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/913)) | sluis holds intermediates only; the roots are [ritueel](https://ritueel.id)'s ([ADR 0013](/decisions/0013-the-hand-off-to-root-custody-and-the-signing-api/)). |
| [RFC 5280 §5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280#section-5) | Certificate Revocation Lists | A static, published CRL. | Target in v2 | Short lifetimes are the main control; revocation lists back them. |

## Workload identity

Machine identity follows SPIFFE. sluis is its own SPIFFE issuer; SPIRE is not deployed and is read as prior art. A trust domain is a boundary, so each environment has its own trust domain, bundle and issuer. The isolation controls that rest on these rows are in the [threat model](/security/threat-model/).

| Identifier | Title | What sluis uses it for | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [SPIFFE ID](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/standards/SPIFFE-ID.md) | The SPIFFE Identity and Verifiable Identity Document | The name of every machine identity: hosts, Kubernetes service accounts, actors and CI jobs. | Target in v2 | A full claim. Paths are `/host/<name>`, `/k8s/<cluster>/ns/<ns>/sa/<sa>`, `/sluis/<actor>` and `/ci/github/<org>/<repo>` ([Identity](/concepts/identity/)). |
| [SPIFFE Trust Domain and Bundle](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/standards/SPIFFE_Trust_Domain_and_Bundle.md) | The SPIFFE Trust Domain and Bundle | The per-environment trust bundle that hosts and workloads install. | Target in v2 | A full claim. Each certificate in the bundle chains to a root in the root list; a lower `spiffe_sequence` is refused. |
| [X.509-SVID](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/standards/X509-SVID.md) | The X.509 SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document | Host and workload certificates from the `ca` actor, and mutual TLS between actors of different boundaries. | Target in v2 ([#913](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/913)) | A full claim. The SPIFFE ID comes from the requester's authenticated identity, never from the request. |
| [JWT-SVID](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/standards/JWT-SVID.md) | The JWT SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document | Workload tokens from the per-environment issuer, which also issues the tokens of actors on nodes. | Target in v2 | A full claim. `sub` is the SPIFFE ID. |
| [SPIFFE Federation](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/standards/SPIFFE_Federation.md) | SPIFFE Federation | Exchanging bundles with the trust domains of other operators. | Later | Until then trust between installations is declared in the install files. |
| [SPIFFE Workload Endpoint](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/standards/SPIFFE_Workload_Endpoint.md) | The SPIFFE Workload Endpoint | A local endpoint that hands SVIDs to workloads. | Later | A workload gets its SVID by token exchange. |
| [SPIFFE Workload API](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/standards/SPIFFE_Workload_API.md) | The SPIFFE Workload API | The API behind the Workload Endpoint, for standard SPIFFE client libraries. | Later | Comes with the Workload Endpoint. |

## TLS

| Identifier | Title | What sluis uses it for | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [RFC 8446](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446) | TLS 1.3 | Raft peer traffic over mutual TLS; the edge connector's outbound connection. | Target in v2 | Go's TLS stack. Public TLS terminates at the edge. |
| [RFC 10024](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc10024) | Post-quantum/traditional hybrid key agreement for TLS 1.3 | `X25519MLKEM768` and the other hybrids. | Later ([#1029](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1029)) | Follows what Go's TLS offers. |

## Signing and supply chain

| Identifier | Title | What sluis uses it for | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [RFC 9580](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9580) | OpenPGP | Detached signatures over release checksums, then signed apt and dnf metadata, through the signing API. | Target in v2 ([#874](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/874), [#1074](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1074)) | Nothing is signed before ritueel's roots exist ([Release signing](/distribution/release-signing/)). apt and rpm accept ECDSA P-384 on version 4 keys (tested 2026-10-31). |
| [Sigstore cosign](https://www.sigstore.dev/) | Keyless signing and Sigstore bundles | A possible second signature on releases and images, and a later output of the signing API. | Planned ([#1013](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1013)) | Its role next to OpenPGP is open; the signing API returns a Sigstore bundle later ([ADR 0013](/decisions/0013-the-hand-off-to-root-custody-and-the-signing-api/#the-signing-api)). |
| [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/provenance) | SLSA build provenance | GitHub build provenance attestations for each artifact. | Target in v2 ([#848](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/848)) | Every release states the provenance level it claims (REQ-SUPPLY-008). |
| [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) and CycloneDX | Software bill of materials | An SBOM published with each release. | Target in v2 ([#848](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/848)) | One SBOM per release; the format is chosen with that issue. |
| [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/) | Attestation framework | The statement format of the provenance attestations. | Target in v2 ([#848](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/848)) | The GitHub attestations are in-toto statements. |

## Crypto and compliance

| Identifier | Title | What sluis uses it for | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [FIPS 140-3](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/140-3/final) | Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules | The algorithms stay within the FIPS-approved set (P-384 ECDSA, AES-256-GCM, HKDF-SHA384, SHA-384, and the named exceptions), so that a FIPS build can be added. | Later: a build variant when a customer needs it ([#868](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/868)) | **sluis v2.0 has no FIPS mode and no certified build, and makes no FIPS 140-3 claim** ([ADR 0012](/decisions/0012-cryptography-and-authority-keys/#algorithms)). The variant would use Go's FIPS module and `aws-lc-rs` in FIPS mode. |
| [NIST SP 800-90A](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/90/a/r1/final), [90B](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/90/b/final), [90C](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/90/c/final) | Random bit generation | Go's `crypto/rand` (the OS random source); `sluis doctor` checks the platform. | Target in v2 (the platform checks); the SP 800-90A generator comes with a FIPS variant | SP 800-90C does not require mixing in KMS or YubiKey randomness, so sluis does not. |
| [age](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/age.md) | age encryption | Encrypting backups and the drops that leave sluis, to the consumer's own recipient. | Target in v2 ([#834](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/834), [#835](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/835)) | A named exception in v2.0 ([ADR 0012](/decisions/0012-cryptography-and-authority-keys/#named-exceptions)). The consumer's key can be on its own YubiKey (`age-plugin-yubikey`). |
| [RFC 9180](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180) | Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) | Encrypting a machine's enrolment end to end through the edge, and audit and usage log entries to their company's key. | Target in v2 | The enrolment public key reaches hosts as a certificate in the trust bundle, issued by the boundary's intermediate. The suite follows the P-384 default. |
| [PIV (NIST SP 800-73)](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/73/4/upd1/final) and the OpenPGP card | Smart-card interfaces on a YubiKey | Hardware-held keys for the intermediates and the node keys, including an OpenPGP signing subkey in a PIV slot. | Target in v2 ([#914](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/914)) | The `yubikey-piv` driver, through `key-holder` with exclusive card access ([the card slot map](/concepts/keys/#the-card-slot-map)). The OpenPGP applet is not used on a node. |
| [TCG TPM 2.0](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tpm-library-specification/) | Trusted Platform Module | Optional sealing and node identity. | Later ([#884](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/884)) | Not part of the first release. |

## Transparency and audit

sluis follows the published specifications and invents no format. The audit checkpoints, the witnesses and the issuance log of the `ca` actor use the C2SP family. See [Audit](/concepts/audit/).

| Identifier | Title | What sluis uses it for | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [C2SP signed-note](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/signed-note.md) | Signed note | The envelope of an audit checkpoint. | Target in v2 | Checkpoints are signed with the P-384 log key (signature type 0x02). |
| [C2SP tlog-checkpoint](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/tlog-checkpoint.md) | Transparency log checkpoint | The signed head of the audit log: size and root hash. | Target in v2 | |
| [C2SP tlog-tiles](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/tlog-tiles.md) | Transparency log tiles | The layout of the log as static tiles in a blob store. | Target in v2 | Static objects, readable without a server. |
| [C2SP tlog-cosignature](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/tlog-cosignature.md) | Transparency log cosignature | A witness's signature over a checkpoint. | Target in v2 | Witness keys are Ed25519 or ML-DSA-44. |
| [C2SP tlog-witness](https://c2sp.org/tlog-witness) | Transparency log witness protocol | How a witness is asked to cosign a checkpoint. | Target in v2 | The `peer` and `external` witness drivers. A witness is optional. |
| [C2SP static-ct-api](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/static-ct-api.md) | Static Certificate Transparency API | The issuance log of the `ca` actor: every X.509 certificate it issues is logged, and the log is witnessed. | Target in v2 ([#913](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/913)) | sluis runs its own log; it does not monitor the public ones. |
| [C2SP mtc-tlog](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/mtc-tlog.md) | Merkle Tree Certificates log | The log format for Merkle Tree Certificates. | Later ([#1029](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1029)) | Comes with the post-quantum rows. |
| [RFC 6962 §2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6962#section-2.1) | Merkle hash trees | The tree over audit records and inclusion proofs. | Target in v2 | |
| [RFC 8785](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785) | JSON Canonicalization Scheme | Canonical audit records and usage events: the bytes that are hashed, stored and returned. | Target in v2 | The writer checks that the bytes are canonical. |
| [OCSF](https://schema.ocsf.io/) 1.x | Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework | The audit record: every record is an OCSF event in a core class, with the sluis facts that OCSF has no attribute for in one `unmapped.sluis` object. | Target in v2 ([#841](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/841)) | No OCSF extension in 2.0 ([ADR 0017](/decisions/0017-audit-records-the-usage-stream-and-quota/)). The first release pins 1.9.0 (2026-08-03), current when checked on 2026-11-01. |
| [RFC 5905](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5905) | Network Time Protocol | The audit clock check. | Target in v2 | |
| [RFC 3161](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3161) | Time-Stamp Protocol | An optional external anchor for sealed periods, from a time-stamp authority. | Later | A MAY (REQ-AUDIT-031); some compliance profiles ask for it. |

## Data and interfaces

| Identifier | Title | What sluis uses it for | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [JSON Schema 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) | JSON Schema | The configuration schema and the schemas of audit records and exported documents. | Target in v2 | Generated from the configuration and checked in CI. |
| [ConnectRPC](https://connectrpc.com/), gRPC and Protobuf | Remote procedure calls | Every component boundary, and the public API. | Target in v2 | A TypeScript client library on `connect-es` is a deliverable ([#917](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/917)). |
| [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/) and OTLP | Traces and metrics | Each actor uses the OpenTelemetry API and SDK directly, with no telemetry port; OTLP over HTTP. | Target in v2 ([#836](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/836)) | Standard `OTEL_*` variables; an allowlist redaction processor keeps secrets and personal data out. Logs go to stderr. |
| [W3C Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) | Trace Context | Carrying a trace across processes. | Target in v2 | An audit record may carry the trace id, one way only. |
| [CloudEvents 1.0](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec) | CloudEvents (CNCF) | The usage stream: usage events of a metered action, in the structured JSON format. | Target in v2 ([#915](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/915)) | 1.0.2 (2022-02-06) is the latest release, checked 2026-10-31. Not an envelope for audit records. |
| [FinOps FOCUS](https://focus.finops.org/) 1.4 | FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification | The column names of the finance export derived from the usage log. | Target in v2 ([#915](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/915)) | 1.4 (2026-06-04) is current, checked 2026-10-31. sluis holds no prices. |
| [IETF Idempotency-Key header](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header/) | The Idempotency-Key HTTP header field (an IETF draft) | Safe retries of the quota API. | Target in v2 ([#915](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/915)) | A draft; the row follows it. |
| [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) | Web Content Accessibility Guidelines | The sign-in and consent pages. | Target in v2 | |
| HTTP security headers and cookies ([RFC 6797](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6797), CSP, cookie prefixes) | HSTS, Content Security Policy and cookie prefixes | The headers of the sign-in pages and the session cookie. | Target in v2 | Tested by sluis's own header suite. |

The relying-party ID is the registrable parent of the sluis hosts, with a strict allow-list of origins. Break-glass recovery uses passkeys only ([Break-glass recovery](/security/break-glass/)). |
| [RFC 8176](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8176) | Authentication Method Reference Values | The `amr` values that sluis emits and passes through from an upstream. | Target in v2 ([#885](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/885), [#916](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/916)) | Only the values sluis uses. |
| [RFC 9562](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9562) | Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID version 4) | Random, opaque subject identifiers. | Target in v2 | A subject is assigned when sluis first sees a directory person and is never an e-mail address. |
| [RFC 2945](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2945), [RFC 5054](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5054) | SRP-6a | | Not planned | sluis stores no password; recovery uses passkeys only. |

| [SAML 2.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/) | Security Assertion Markup Language | sluis as a SAML identity provider, for AWS IAM Identity Center. | Later ([#918](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/918)) | A SAML upstream is reached through a CIAM product that speaks OIDC. |
| [Cedar](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/) | Cedar policy language | The language of the `policy` actor, pinned to a version. | Target in v2 ([#892](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/892)) | `policy` is written in Rust with the `cedar-policy` crate ([ADR 0009](/decisions/0009-policy-is-cedar-in-a-rust-actor/)). |
| [OCI Image and Distribution specifications](https://opencontainers.org/) | OCI | Container images and Helm charts for the kubernetes runtime and the local installation. | Target in v2 ([#876](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/876)) | Images are pinned by digest. |
| [Kubernetes API-server OIDC authentication](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens) | OIDC for the Kubernetes API server | A cluster's API server trusts sluis for who a person or a CI job is; the client-go credential plugin signs a person in. | Target in v2 ([#818](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/818), [#827](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/827)) | An interface sluis conforms to, not one it owns. |
| [OpenPubkey](https://github.com/openpubkey/openpubkey) (`opkssh`) | Binding an SSH key to an ID token | | Not planned | sluis's own SSH CA is the only SSH path. |

## What is not on this page

Standards that sluis only passes through, such as the protocols of GitHub, Slack or AWS, are not listed: see the [integration pages](/integrations/). The standards that a feature touches are named on that feature's page.

The register changes with the design: a row's status changes in the pull request that changes the decision or schedules the work, and a claim of conformance is made only when its test passes ([Conformance](/standards/conformance/)).
