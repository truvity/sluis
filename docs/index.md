# Documentation

One entry point. Four other pages here are themselves indexes —
[doctrine.md](doctrine.md), [reference.md](reference.md),
[adoption.md](adoption.md), [safety.md](safety.md) — each the table of
contents for its own pages; this page is where you start when you do not
yet know which of those you want.

## Where to start

- [adoption.md](adoption.md) — prerequisites, install order, connecting
  things, migrating, and the zero-diff gate
- [safety.md](safety.md) — what is refused and why, the failure
  semantics, and the traps
- [reference.md](reference.md) — every value, flag, input and output
- [doctrine.md](doctrine.md) — the design rules, and who owns what
- [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) — what changed for a consumer, per
  version
