**Anchor:** none of ours. An App is created on GitHub by an owner of its
organisation, from a manifest this service posts, and GitHub hands the
App's private key to this service once. Nothing is typed or pasted.

A deployment usually needs more GitHub Apps than the three this service
creates for itself — one for dependency updates, one for releases, one
for a bot that labels pull requests. Each is the same chore by hand: fill
in a form on GitHub, pick permissions, download a key, put the key
somewhere, install the App, write down its ids. The catalogue turns each
into a declaration in the deployment's values and two clicks in the
console.

## Declaring an App

```yaml
githubApps:
  catalogue:
    - id: renovate                 # [a-z0-9-], at most 32, unique; never changes
      org: example-org             # the organisation the App is created under
      name: example-org-renovate   # optional; default <org>-<id>, at most 34
      description: Dependency updates for example-org
      public: false                # a private App installs only on example-org
      permissions:                 # GitHub's permission names: read | write | admin
        contents: write
        pull_requests: write
        issues: write
        workflows: write
      events: []                   # optional; the webhook stays inactive regardless
      installation: all            # all | selected (default): what the installer is expected to pick
      grants:
        - group: all:platform:engineer
          repositories: ["*"]
          permissions: {contents: read, pull_requests: read}
        - group: all:docs:writer
          repositories: [docs, "site-*"]
          permissions: {contents: write, pull_requests: write}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | the App's name **here**: where it is kept and what a token request will name. Lower-case letters, digits and dashes, at most 32. Renaming it forgets the App (see [Disconnecting](#disconnecting)) |
| `org` | the organisation's login. The App is created under it, and an App created under anything else is refused |
| `name` | the App's name on GitHub, which is global across GitHub. Empty is `<org>-<id>`, cut to 34 characters; a declared name over 34 is refused |
| `description` | shown on the App's page on GitHub and in the console |
| `public` | whether any account may install it. Leave it `false` unless something outside the organisation installs the App |
| `permissions` | the App's permissions, by the names GitHub's REST API uses (`contents`, `pull_requests`, `members`, `organization_administration`, …), each `read`, `write` or `admin`. At least one |
| `events` | the webhook events the App subscribes to. The webhook is never active: nothing in this service receives one |
| `installation` | `all` or `selected`. GitHub's install page is where the installer chooses; this says which choice the deployment expects, and the console shows both |
| `grants` | who may ask for a token of this App — see below |
| `push` | optional: copy this App's credential to a secret store, for a consumer that cannot ask the issuer when it runs — see [Projecting one App to a secret store](#projecting-one-app-to-a-secret-store) |

The catalogue is rendered into `ConfigMap <release>-github-apps-catalogue`,
mounted, and read once at start; a change rolls the service out. **The
service refuses to start** on an unknown key, a duplicate id, a level
that is not `read`, `write` or `admin`, a name GitHub would refuse, a
grant above the App, a glob that does not compile, or a grant naming a
group the policy does not declare. A wrong declaration found at start
costs a rollout; one found after the App was created costs an owner's
edit on GitHub, because nothing here can change an App's permissions.

## A default set

Every estate on GitHub needs the same few automations, and every estate
builds them by hand. The set below is shipped as values to copy —
`charts/sluis/examples/github-apps.yaml` in this repository —
rather than as a default the chart applies, because creating an App is an
owner of the organisation confirming a manifest, and that stays a
deliberate act.

| App | Does | Permissions | Installed on |
|---|---|---|---|
| `renovate-public` | dependency updates in **public** repositories | `contents: write`, `pull_requests: write`, `issues: write`, `workflows: write`, `checks: read` | the public repositories, selected |
| `renovate-private` | the same, in **private** repositories | the same | the private repositories, selected |
| `ci-automation` | approves bot pull requests; cuts release tags | `contents: write`, `pull_requests: write`, `checks: read` | selected |
| `iac` | the program that manages the organisation: repositories, teams, rulesets, settings | `organization_administration: write`, `members: write`, `administration: write`, `contents: read` | all repositories |

**Why four identities and not one.** An App *is* an identity, and its
permissions are the whole of what a stolen key can do. One App with every
permission is one key that can do everything, installed everywhere, used
by every automation — and nothing reading the audit trail afterwards can
say which automation acted. Four Apps cost four creations once, and each
is separately installable, scoped and revocable.

The three separations that carry weight:

- **Public and private dependency updates are two Apps.** The split is
  the privilege boundary, and the **installation** enforces it: the
  public App is installed on the public repositories only, so the App
  whose pull requests, logs and forks are world-readable cannot read a
  private repository at all. One App installed on both would be a single
  key reaching everything, and no setting inside the updater would change
  that.
- **`ci-automation` approves, and cannot change what it satisfies.** An
  App's review counts as an approving review, so a ruleset requiring one
  is satisfied without a person rubber-stamping a version bump, and the
  approval is a reviewable act in the pull request's timeline. It holds
  no administration permission: an approver that can edit the rule it
  satisfies satisfies nothing.
- **`iac` administers, and approves nothing.** It holds
  `administration: write`, which includes a repository's rulesets and
  branch protection. Keep it out of the approving and merging path even
  when one pipeline runs both — that is the same rule read from the other
  side.

`workflows: write` is on the updaters because a dependency update touches
`.github/workflows` (an action pinned by digest is a dependency like any
other) and GitHub refuses such a push from a token without it. `metadata:
read` is on every App; GitHub gives it to anything that touches
repositories, and it is never drift.

Copy the entries, change `example-org`, add `grants` for whoever should
be able to mint tokens of each, and for `iac` add the `push` block that
[hands its credential to the program](infrastructure-as-code.md).

## Grants

A grant says that the holders of one policy group may ask for an
installation token of the App, for some of its repositories, with at most
some of its permissions:

```yaml
grants:
  - group: all:docs:writer            # a group the policy declares
    repositories: [docs, "site-*"]    # names or globs, within the App's organisation
    permissions: {contents: write}    # the most a token may carry
```

- `repositories` are repository names in the App's organisation, or
  globs in Go's `path.Match` syntax (`*`, `?`, `[a-c]`). `["*"]` is every
  repository. No `/`: a grant never reaches another organisation.
- every permission in a grant must be one the App has, at a level no
  higher than the App's: `read` < `write` < `admin`. A grant of
  `contents: write` on an App with `contents: read` is refused.
- a group may appear in several grants; each is read on its own.

How a grant becomes a token is [Minting a token](#minting-a-token).

## Minting a token

A caller exchanges the proof it already holds — a GitHub Actions job's
identity token, a cluster workload's ServiceAccount token, or a person's
`sluisctl login` — for an installation token of one App. The proof is
verified exactly as for [any other exchange](github-actions.md), and
resolves to the same groups; the App's grants for those groups then
decide. Nothing is stored: every token is minted from GitHub on request,
and every request is audited.

### From a job

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write                       # the job's identity token, for the issuer
  contents: read
steps:
  - id: access
    uses: truvity/sluis@v1.11.0
    with:
      issuer: https://access.example.com
      github-app: publisher             # the catalogue id
      repositories: app, lib-core       # names, without the owner
      permissions: contents:write, pull_requests:write
  - run: gh release create "v1.2.3" --repo example-org/app
    env:
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.access.outputs.github-token }}   # masked
```

`audiences` may be left out when a job wants only the GitHub token, or
given beside it for clusters and cloud roles in the same step.

Or with `sluisctl`, which picks the job's identity token up from the
environment and the sign-in on a laptop, so the same line serves both:

```sh
sluisctl github-token --app publisher --repository app --permission contents=write
sluisctl github-token --app publisher --repository app --json
# {"token":"ghs_…","expires_at":"2026-01-01T13:00:00Z","repositories":["app"],"permissions":{"contents":"write"}}
```

Or raw, with nothing of ours at all:

```sh
curl --fail-with-body -sS -u 'github-app%3Apublisher:' \
  --data-urlencode grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange \
  --data-urlencode "subject_token=${JOB_ID_TOKEN}" \
  --data-urlencode subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt \
  --data-urlencode requested_token_type=urn:access-roster:params:oauth:token-type:github-installation-token \
  --data-urlencode audience=github-app:publisher \
  --data-urlencode 'repositories=app lib-core' \
  --data-urlencode 'scope=contents:write pull_requests:write' \
  https://access.example.com/token | jq -r .access_token
```

The exact wire contract is in
[the reference](../../reference/contracts.md#installation-tokens-at-token).

### Pinning a grant to one workflow

A grant names a **group**; the **policy** says which proofs hold it. For
a token that can write to a repository, the group should admit one
reviewed workflow file on the default branch, not every job in the
repository — a pull request's run of an edited workflow is a job in the
repository too. A `github` matcher pins exactly that:

```yaml
# policy
groups:
  all:app:publisher:
    matchers:
      - github:
          repository: example-org/app
          ref: refs/heads/main
          ref_type: branch
          event_name: push
          job_workflow_ref: example-org/app/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/heads/main
```

```yaml
# values: githubApps.catalogue
- id: publisher
  org: example-org
  permissions: {contents: write, pull_requests: write}
  installation: selected
  grants:
    - group: all:app:publisher
      repositories: [app, "lib-*"]
      permissions: {contents: write, pull_requests: write}
```

`job_workflow_ref` is the file the **job** is defined in, at its ref:
for a reusable workflow it is the called file, which is the code that
holds the token. `workflow_ref` is the file the run started from. Both,
with `sha`, `event_name` and `ref_type`, are read from GitHub's token and
matched as globs where `*` does not cross a `/`
([policy](../../reference/policy.md#proof--groups)).

### One grant covers the whole request

Of the App's grants whose group the proof holds, **in catalogue order**,
the first that covers all of the request is the one the token is minted
under. Two grants are never added together.

- **Repositories named:** each must match some grant the proof holds,
  and the chosen grant must match all of them. `app` and `docs` from two
  different grants are two tokens.
- **No repositories named:** the chosen grant must be for every
  repository, `["*"]`, and the token is not narrowed to any — it reaches
  what the installation reaches. Otherwise the request is refused with
  *name the repositories*.
- **Permissions named:** the chosen grant must cover each, at its level
  or above (`read` < `write` < `admin`).
- **No permissions named:** the token asks for exactly the chosen
  grant's permissions — never the App's whole set.

GitHub is always sent an explicit narrowing, `{"repositories": [...],
"permissions": {...}}` (repositories left out when none were named), so
what the installation holds beyond the grant never reaches the token. A
repository the installer did not select, or a permission the
installation has not accepted, is GitHub's refusal and comes back as
`invalid_scope` with GitHub's words.

### Errors

| `error` | HTTP | When |
|---|---|---|
| `invalid_request` | 400 | a malformed request: `actor_token` given (delegation is not served), a repository spelled with its owner, a permission not `name:read\|write\|admin`, subject token or its type missing |
| `invalid_client` | 401 | a client was presented, other than the App's audience, and did not authenticate |
| `invalid_grant` | 400 | the subject token is not a proof: unverifiable, or a sign-in presented by a client other than its own, or its session ended |
| `invalid_target` | 400 | the App cannot mint — not declared, not created, not installed, uninstalled on GitHub — **or** no grant of the App names a group the proof holds. The description says which, as for an ordinary exchange |
| `invalid_scope` | 400 | the request is wider than every one grant the proof holds: a repository outside them, two repositories no one grant covers, a permission above them, no repositories named where no grant is `["*"]`, or GitHub refusing the narrowing |
| `server_error` | 500 | GitHub failing, or the App's key failing |

`sluisctl github-token` exits `4` on every refusal and `5` when the
issuer cannot be reached.

### Audit

One record per request, minted or refused: action
`roster.github_token.minted`, outcome `success`, `denied` (refused) or
`failure` (GitHub or the key). The actor is the proof's subject, by kind —
a CI job (`github:example-org/app`), a workload (its ServiceAccount), a
person (their address) — or `anonymous` for a request refused before any
proof was read; the target is the App (`github_app`, its catalogue id); the
reason is the description the caller was given. Its data:

| Property | Holds |
|---|---|
| `proof` | `ci`, `workload` or `person` |
| `org` | the App's organisation |
| `grant` | the group of the grant the token was minted under |
| `repositories` | a list: what GitHub granted, or what was asked for when refused |
| `permissions` | `name:level`, space separated, likewise |
| `installation` | the installation id |
| `expires_at` | when the token stops working |

**The token itself is never recorded**, nor any part of it.

### Recent tokens, on the App's page

An App's page in the console shows the last ten requests made of it under
*Recent tokens*: when, who asked and how they proved it, the grant it was
decided under, the repositories and permissions, and whether it was
minted, refused or failed — with the refusal's reason in the chip's
tooltip. The token is not there, because nothing keeps it.

It is this service's own memory of those requests, kept beside the half
that mints them: bounded to the last ten of each App, since the process
started, and forgotten on a restart, which the page says under the table.
It is **not** the record. The record is the audit trail above, which holds
every request for as long as the installation keeps it, and every reading
of that section links to the console's Audit page narrowed to that App
(`#/audit?q=action:roster.github_token.minted target:github_app:<id>`, an
address to send somebody). The section exists so that an App's page loads
without asking the trail anything, and works with no installation
connected.

An internal group's page carries the one fact that falls out of the same
memory: when each grant it holds was last used. A grant with nothing
beside it is one nothing is remembered for — after a restart that is every
grant — and never one that is known to be unused.

## Creating and installing

The *Apps* tab of the GitHub page lists every App this service keeps a
key for or is declared to — the link App, each organisation's controller
App and every App the catalogue declares — grouped by organisation, those
needing an operator first. The runner tiers' Apps are on the *Runners* tab,
in the same shape. Each App has a page of its own.

1. **Create.** An operator presses *Create* on the App's page. The browser posts the App's
   manifest to GitHub's create page for the organisation; an owner of
   the organisation confirms. GitHub returns to
   `/connect/github/catalogue/callback` with a one-time code, and the
   service exchanges it for the App's id and private key. The App now
   reads *created, not installed*.
2. **Install.** The browser goes straight on to the App's install page.
   The owner picks all or selected repositories and installs. GitHub
   returns to `/connect/github/catalogue/setup`; the service asks GitHub,
   as the App, where it is installed on the organisation — the id in the
   redirect is a browser's word for it — and keeps that.

If the owner stops between the two, the App's page offers *Install*,
which picks up where they left off rather than creating a second App.
Both redirects check the flow cookie against a state signed by this
service naming the App and the operator who started; a state from any
other GitHub flow is refused.

## Who may

Creating, installing, re-checking and disconnecting a catalogue App need the
**operator** role over the directory recorded as the owner of the App's
organisation (the operator role `<directory id>:access-roster:operator`), or the
installation-wide operator. An App of an organisation nobody has connected yet
can be created by anyone who could connect that organisation (see
[Connect a GitHub organisation](github-organisation.md#adding-one-organisation));
that connect records the owner. A viewer sees the Apps of the organisations they
may view, and each row says whether they may operate it. Only the
installation-wide operator changes an organisation's owner, with *Change owner*
on the organisation's page or its controller App's page. The callbacks ask the
role question again of whoever is signed in then.

## Where the key is kept

Every catalogue App is in one Secret, `<release>-github-catalogue-apps`,
created empty at the service's first start:

| Key | Holds |
|---|---|
| `<id>.github_app_id` | the App's numeric id |
| `<id>.github_app_installation_id` | the installation on the organisation |
| `<id>.github_app_private_key` | the App's private key, PEM, exactly as GitHub issued it |
| `<id>.record.json` | the App's record: `version`, `id`, `org`, `app_id`, `app_slug`, `installation_id`, `html_url`, `connected_at`, `connected_by` |
| `<id>.pending_private_key` | the key of an App created and **not yet installed**, instead of the three above |

The three property keys exist only once the App is installed, so a copy
taken between the two clicks never hands anything an App that cannot
mint a token. No copy of a key exists anywhere else — not in git, not in
a password manager.

### Backing it up

A deployment copies the Secret to a store that travels with its backups.
An External Secrets `PushSecret` does that for any provider External
Secrets writes to — a Vault or OpenBao, a cloud secret manager — and the
restore is the matching `ExternalSecret`:

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1alpha1
kind: PushSecret
metadata:
  name: access-issuer-github-catalogue-apps
  namespace: access-issuer
spec:
  refreshInterval: 1h
  deletionPolicy: None            # a forgotten App's copy stays until removed by hand
  secretStoreRefs:
    - name: backup-store          # a SecretStore for your Vault, OpenBao or cloud manager
      kind: SecretStore
  selector:
    secret:
      name: access-issuer-github-catalogue-apps
  data:
    - match:
        secretKey: renovate.github_app_private_key
        remoteRef:
          remoteKey: access-issuer/github-apps/renovate
          property: private_key
    - match:
        secretKey: renovate.github_app_id
        remoteRef:
          remoteKey: access-issuer/github-apps/renovate
          property: app_id
    - match:
        secretKey: renovate.github_app_installation_id
        remoteRef:
          remoteKey: access-issuer/github-apps/renovate
          property: installation_id
    - match:
        secretKey: renovate.record.json
        remoteRef:
          remoteKey: access-issuer/github-apps/renovate
          property: record
```

One block of four entries per App. The same keys are what anything else
that needs the App — a job that mints its own tokens today — reads, under
names that do not change for the life of the App.

**Restoring** is putting the Secret back, with its label
`access-roster.truvity.github.io/kind: github-catalogue-apps`, before the
service starts. The records are beside the keys, so nothing else is
needed ([configuration](../../reference/configuration.md#restoring-from-the-secrets-alone)).

That is a **backup**: every App, every key, one place, read by nobody
until a restore. Handing one App to a consumer is the next section, and
it is deliberately a different object.

### Projecting one App to a secret store

> **On a State adapter, use an export.** `push` is **deprecated**: it renders a
> PushSecret over the Kubernetes Secret only the `legacy` storage writes. With
> `ports.adapter` other than `legacy` the service copies the App itself, with
> `exports: [{source: github-app, app: <id>, path: <path>}]` into an OpenBao KV
> mount, written as `app_id`, `installation_id` and `private_key`, the properties
> `push` wrote
> ([configuration reference](../../reference/configuration.md#exports-and-the-export-port),
> [0034](../../decisions/0034-exports-go-to-openbao-directly.md)).

Some consumers cannot ask the issuer at the moment they run. The one this
was built for is the program that manages the estate — a Pulumi or
Terraform apply that must work while this service is being upgraded,
replaced or restored. For those, an entry may carry `push`, and the chart
renders a `PushSecret` that copies **that App's three property keys** to
a store and a path the operator names:

```yaml
githubApps:
  catalogue:
    - id: iac
      org: example-org
      permissions: {organization_administration: write, members: write, administration: write, contents: read}
      installation: all
      push:
        secretStore:
          name: example-store        # a store you already have
          kind: ClusterSecretStore   # SecretStore (default) | ClusterSecretStore
        remoteKey: platform/github-apps/iac
        refreshInterval: 1h          # optional; 1h
        deletionPolicy: None         # optional; None (default) | Delete
```

| At `remoteKey` | From the Secret | Is |
|---|---|---|
| `app_id` | `<id>.github_app_id` | the App's numeric id |
| `installation_id` | `<id>.github_app_installation_id` | its installation on the organisation |
| `private_key` | `<id>.github_app_private_key` | the App's private key, PEM |

- **Off unless written.** No entry pushes anything by default, and the
  chart invents neither the store nor the path.
- **Three keys, never the Secret.** The record is not pushed, and no
  other App's keys are in the object. The three exist only once the App
  is installed, so an App created and left uninstalled pushes nothing.
- **Refused at render:** two entries pushing to one path in one store
  (one would overwrite the other, and the reader could not tell which
  App's key it held), and `push` without `config.store: kubernetes`
  (there would be no Secret to push from).
- **What lands there is a real credential** — the App's private key, a
  second durable copy, to be rotated as one, and the store that holds it
  is in the App's blast radius.

The worked consumer, the rotation procedure and when to prefer the
run-time exchange instead are in
[Connect an infrastructure-as-code program](infrastructure-as-code.md).

## State and drift

Each App reads one of four states:

| State | Means |
|---|---|
| *not created* | declared, and nobody has created it on GitHub |
| *created, not installed* | the owner stopped after Create; *Install* finishes |
| *installed* | installed, and GitHub holds what the catalogue declares |
| *differs on GitHub* | GitHub holds something else; the page lists each difference |

The service asks GitHub, as the App, for the App (`GET /app`) and its
installation (`GET /app/installations/{id}`), and compares:

- **the App's permissions with the declaration.** A permission GitHub
  holds that the catalogue does not declare, one it lacks, and one at a
  different level are each a line. `metadata: read` is not drift: GitHub
  gives it to every App that touches repositories.
- **the App's events**, when the catalogue declares any.
- **the installation's accepted permissions with the App's.** When an
  owner adds a permission to an App, every installation keeps the old
  set until somebody approves the request on GitHub; until then the
  page says *approve the permission request on GitHub*.
- **the installation itself.** One uninstalled on GitHub, or suspended,
  is said as such.

What GitHub said is kept for a minute, so a page left open does not spend
the App's rate limit; *Re-check* asks again at once. A failure to ask —
GitHub down, egress closed, a damaged key — is shown as the App's reason,
and the rest of the GitHub page is unaffected.

**Why the fix is a human edit.** GitHub has no API to change an App's
permissions, events or name: a manifest creates an App once, and after
that only its owner can edit it, in the App's settings on GitHub. So the
console shows the difference and links to
`https://github.com/organizations/<org>/settings/apps/<slug>`; the owner
changes the App (or the catalogue changes to match it), approves the
installation's request if one appears, and presses *Re-check*.

## Disconnecting

*Disconnect* uninstalls the App from the organisation, then forgets its
record and every key it had here. A failed uninstall still forgets, and
says what is left to do on GitHub. **It does not delete the App on
GitHub** — the API cannot — so the registration stays for its owner to
delete in the App's settings, which the console links to.

An App whose entry is removed from the catalogue, or whose `id` changes,
stays listed as *no longer declared* so it can be disconnected; it cannot
be created again under that id until it is declared again.

## What it leaves behind

| Object | Holds | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| ConfigMap `<release>-github-apps-catalogue` | the declaration, `catalogue.yaml` | the chart, when `githubApps.catalogue` is not empty |
| Secret `<release>-github-catalogue-apps` | every catalogue App's keys and record, as above | the service, on Create and Install; created empty at start |
| PushSecret `<release>-github-app-<id>` | the copy instruction for one App's three property keys | the chart, for each entry carrying `push` |

Audit records: `roster.catalogue_app.created`, `.installed` and
`.disconnected`, each naming the App by catalogue id and carrying GitHub's
id; and `roster.github_token.minted` for every installation token asked for
