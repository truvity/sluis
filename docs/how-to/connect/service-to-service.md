# A service calls another service

What a workload presents when it calls one of ours, what the called
service accepts, and how to build a service of your own that gets both
right. The rule underneath is [trust model](../../explanation/trust.md):
**two anchors, chosen by scope** — the cluster for a workload next door,
the issuer for everything further away.

## Decide which anchor, in one question

*Is the caller a workload in the same cluster as the service?*

| Yes | No |
|---|---|
| present the caller's **ServiceAccount token**, projected for the service's audience | obtain an **issuer token** first — by exchange for a workload or a CI job, by sign-in for a person — and present that |

That is the whole decision. Do not put an exchange in front of a
same-cluster call "for uniformity": the issuer would verify the same
ServiceAccount token and re-sign it, a round trip that adds no trust on
the hottest paths in the estate. Do not verify another cluster's keys
directly to avoid the issuer: that is a third anchor per cluster, and
the issuer exists so that decision is made once.

## Calling with a ServiceAccount token (same cluster)

The caller mounts a projected token **for the service's audience**. A
token for any other audience — the API server's default included — is
refused, which is what keeps every mounted token in the cluster from
being a credential for every service in it.

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: my-service-token
    projected:
      sources:
        - serviceAccountToken:
            audience: my-service            # the service's audience, from its values
            expirationSeconds: 3600
            path: token
```

Read the file on **every call**, not once: the kubelet rotates it under
the pod. Send it as `Authorization: Bearer …` — there is no client
library for this and none is needed, because it is a file and a header.

On the service side, the caller must be **named**. Reaching the port is
not being allowed to ask: state the callers your listener admits and
treat an empty list as admitting nobody rather than everybody. A
NetworkPolicy admitting the caller's namespace is the second layer, never
the only one.

## Calling with an issuer token (anywhere else)

A **workload in another cluster** exchanges its own ServiceAccount token
at the issuer for a token whose audience is the service:

```
POST /token
Authorization: Basic base64(<the service's client id>:)
grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange
subject_token=<the workload's ServiceAccount token>
subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt
audience=<the service's client id>
```

The caller **names itself in the Basic header, with an empty secret**.
An exchange client has no secret — the subject token is the credential
— but the library authenticates every token request by HTTP Basic, and
a `client_id` sent only in the form is refused as `invalid_client`.
Verified 2026-09-12 with a stage ServiceAccount token traded for
`exchange-probe`.

The issuer verifies the subject token against the **key set that cluster
publishes** for its own ServiceAccount tokens — never by calling the
cluster. It then resolves the ServiceAccount through the policy's
`service_account` matchers to internal groups, checks the client's
`requires`, and mints. The service verifies the result against the
issuer's JWKS and its own audience, the same verifier a console uses for
a forwarded bearer.

Connecting a cluster's workloads is therefore one row and no credential:

```yaml
exchange:
  clusters:
    - name: dev
      issuer: https://oidc.eks.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/id/EXAMPLE
```

EKS publishes that key set per cluster — it is what IRSA rests on — and
Talos serves the same keys at the API server's `/openid/v1/jwks`. The
issuer's own cluster is a row like any other, and the issuer holds access
to none of them.

What this gives up, said plainly: a TokenReview would notice a deleted
ServiceAccount and a key set does not, so a token stays usable until it
expires. Bound tokens are short-lived, so the window is minutes — and the
alternative was a kubeconfig per cluster held by the service whose whole
design is to hold almost no credential.

A **CI job** does the same with its platform token: see
[github-actions.md](github-actions.md). A **person** — a laptop over
the network, a script an engineer runs — signs in once with `sluisctl
login` and exchanges from the cached login: `sluisctl token --audience
<client id>` prints the token, `sluisctl exchange` the whole response.

That works because the CLI's own client, a `public` one, declares
`sign_in_exchange: true`: of every token this issuer signs, the access
token of a live sign-in at such a client, presented by that client, is
the **only** one the exchange takes as a proof. An ID token names a
person too, and is handed to every relying party they sign in to, so it
is refused — a holder of one could otherwise exchange it for any
audience the person's groups admit.

Every one of these needs the service declared as a **client** in the
policy, with `requires` naming the internal groups that may call it:

```yaml
groups:
  all:inventory:reader:
    matchers:
      - service_account: { namespace: team-sync, name: team-sync }   # a workload, this or any cluster the issuer trusts
clients:
  inventory:
    kind: public
    requires: [all:inventory:reader, all:access-roster:operator]
```

The group is named for what it is a role *on* — `<scope>:<thing>:<role>`,
here a reader of the directory across the installation — not for who is
in it ([naming](../../explanation/trust.md#naming)).

## Building a service that accepts callers

Serve people and workloads with **one anchor each**, and never mount an
operator RPC where a workload's proof alone admits. Two listeners is the
plain way to keep them apart; one listener with both verifiers, which is
what sluis's own API does, works when every route says which
proof it takes:

| Listener | Behind | Verifier | Accepts |
|---|---|---|---|
| console | gateway-native OIDC on Envoy Gateway (the default), upstream oauth2-proxy run by hand on any other gateway, or your own code flow | `Issuer` (issuer URL + this console's client id) | people |
| API | Service DNS | `Cluster` (a token check, audience, the names it admits), and `Issuer` too when remote callers exist | workloads here; anything further away through the issuer |

`Cluster` takes the check as a function: a TokenReview against your own
API server, or a verification against the cluster's published key set
as sluis does, so that it holds no access to the cluster it runs
in.

In Go, both verifiers come from the module as **structs** and a listener
composes what it needs:

```go
cluster := &identity.Cluster{
    Review:   kube.ReviewToken,        // yours, or client-go's
    Audience: "my-service",
    Name:     "prod",                  // so the same namespace on two clusters is two callers
    Groups:   []string{"prod:k8s:admin"},
}
issuer := &identity.Issuer{
    URL:      "https://issuer.example.internal",
    Audience: "my-service",            // this service's client id at the issuer
}

// Either anchor, tried in order, first to answer wins.
http.ListenAndServe(":8080", identity.Middleware(cluster, issuer)(api))
```

**Structs and not constructors, and no `ctx`.** A service must start
whether or not the issuer is reachable: discovery is lazy and cached, and
the key set refetches itself when a signature names a key it has not
seen, which makes rotation a non-event.

**`Review` is supplied, not built**, or every consumer that only needs
the issuer would inherit Kubernetes client libraries for a path it never
runs. **`Groups` is stated by the listener**, because a TokenReview says
*who* and never *what they may do* — a token the issuer signed carries
its groups, a ServiceAccount token does not.

Whichever anchor proved the caller, the handler sees one
`identity.Verified` and cannot tell which answered. **The grant is keyed
by the caller, not by the anchor**: a consumer proven either way is the
same consumer and gets the same answer. If your service keeps a grant
table of its own, key it the same way, so there is one table behind both
doors.

A verifier that could not **reach** the issuer stops the chain rather
than falling through to the next one, because trying the next would turn
an outage into *your token is bad* and send a legitimate caller to
authenticate again, repeatedly.

A service that serves **only workloads next door** needs only the
cluster verifier and no client at the issuer. A service that serves
**only people** needs only the issuer verifier, behind the proxy, and no
API listener at all. Add the second anchor when the second kind of
caller appears, not before.

## What never to do

- **A shared secret between two services.** There is always a
  ServiceAccount token or an issuer token to use instead.
- **An API key on the console listener**, or a browser session on the
  API listener. Two ports, two anchors.
- **Trusting a header** (`X-Forwarded-Email` and friends) outside a
  local run. It asks who can reach the port, not who signed anything.
- **Re-mapping group names** on the way in. The name in the policy is
  the name in the token is the name in your role check.

## Recovery is not one of these

Break-glass at the service and the issuer is a person minting a
ServiceAccount token by hand. It is the cluster anchor used deliberately
as the floor for the day the issuer is unavailable, not a pattern for a
service to imitate: see [trust model](../../explanation/trust.md#recovery-is-the-root-not-a-back-door).
