# Connect ArgoCD

**Anchor:** the issuer; ArgoCD runs its own OIDC code flow, so no proxy.
It reads groups from the ID token and maps them in its own policy;
nothing about that policy changes when the issuer does.

1. A client in the issuer's policy:
   ```yaml
   clients:
     argocd:
       kind: confidential
       display_name: Argo CD          # the sign-in page: "Sign in to continue to Argo CD"
       description: deployments on the prod cluster
       secret: argocd-oidc-client
       redirects:  [https://argocd.example.internal/auth/callback]
       signed_out: [https://argocd.example.internal/]
       requires:   [prod:k8s:admin, prod:k8s:viewer]
   ```
2. ArgoCD's `oidc.config`:
   ```yaml
   name: Corporate
   issuer: https://issuer.example.internal
   clientID: $argocd-secret:oidc.clientID
   clientSecret: $argocd-secret:oidc.clientSecret
   requestedScopes: [openid, profile, email, groups]
   logoutURL: https://issuer.example.internal/end_session?id_token_hint={{token}}&post_logout_redirect_uri=https://argocd.example.internal
   ```
3. `policy.csv` binds the **cluster tier** of its own scope —
   `g, prod:k8s:admin, role:admin` — rather than owning a
   `prod:argocd:*` name: being admin of the cluster is the
   qualification for being admin of the ArgoCD that manages it
   ([naming](../../explanation/trust.md#naming)). Give ArgoCD a `thing` of its
   own only when its ladder genuinely diverges from the cluster's.
   During a rename, list both spellings; drop the old with the old
   issuer.
4. Keep ArgoCD's local admin until a policy-granted identity has signed in
   as an admin, then `admin.enabled: "false"`.

The `argocd` CLI logs in through the same client with the browser flow;
no separate client is needed.

`oidc.config` has no signing-algorithm setting and needs none: ArgoCD
verifies with go-oidc's provider verifier, which takes the algorithms the
issuer's discovery document advertises (its `util/oidc/provider.go`), so
the chart's default ES384 key verifies as an RSA one would. An
installation with a relying party that accepts RS256 only sets
`signingKey.certificate: {algorithm: RSA, size: 2048, encoding: PKCS1}`
([reference](../../reference/configuration.md)).

`display_name` and `description` are shown to anyone who starts a
sign-in, so they carry nothing a stranger should not read. ArgoCD runs
its own session, so a revoke at the issuer reaches it at its next token
refresh; it does not consume a back-channel logout.
