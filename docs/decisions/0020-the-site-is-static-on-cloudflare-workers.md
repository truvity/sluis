# 0020 — The site is static on Cloudflare Workers, deployed by GitHub Actions, with a live status API

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-11-01

Proposal: [issue #1010](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1010).

## Context

The site at sluis.id is built from `docs/` and `site/` with Astro Starlight, with the v1 documentation copied in under `/v1/`. Until 2026-10-31 it was served by GitHub Pages behind the Cloudflare proxy. Measured with `curl` on 2026-10-31, every page view went to GitHub (`cache-control: max-age=600`, `cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC`), and the site sent no `content-security-policy`, `x-frame-options`, `permissions-policy` or `referrer-policy`: a visible gap for an identity and security project.

GitHub Pages sets no custom headers, has no server-side redirects (only meta-refresh pages), and gives a status page no place to hold a token for live data; unauthenticated browser calls to the GitHub API are limited per visitor address. Cloudflare's documentation tells new projects to start on Workers, and the Astro Cloudflare adapter targets Workers only.

The project board has a single-select field, `Product milestone`, whose options are the product milestones in order. Requirements link the issues that deliver them through `issues:` ([Requirements](/contributing/requirements/)).

## Decision

- **Astro Starlight stays, and every docs page stays prerendered,** so Pagefind search keeps working. The static output is served by Cloudflare Workers with static assets, through the official `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter.
- **Only two things run as Worker code:** the `/api/*` routes and one server island on the status page. Every other request is a static asset and does not invoke the Worker. The adapter's route cache (`cacheCloudflare()`) is not used, because it turns on Workers Cache, which bills static asset requests.
- **GitHub Actions builds and deploys the site.** The deploy job runs on a push to `main`, or a manual run from `main`, after the site checks have passed, and runs `wrangler deploy`. Deploys never overlap.
- **The deploy runs in the GitHub environment `cloudflare`, which allows `main` only** and holds the deploy's secrets: the Cloudflare API token, the account identifier and the KV namespace id. A pull request, a fork's included, never gets them.
- **The token can deploy this one Worker only, and it expires.** The maintainer creates and rotates it.
- **No `workers.dev` hostname and no preview URLs.** The Worker sets `workers_dev` and `preview_urls` to false, because either would publish the operator's account subdomain on a public repository. Pull requests are judged by GitHub CI, which runs the same build and a dry-run deploy with no Cloudflare credential, and by `wrangler dev` on a checkout.
- **The Cloudflare resources are declared in the operator's own infrastructure code,** outside this repository: the Worker, the KV namespace and its custom domains. The repository names bindings, never an account id or a namespace id.
- **Security headers come from a `_headers` file** (Content-Security-Policy with `frame-ancestors`, and Permissions-Policy). **Redirects come from a `_redirects` file** that the build writes from the site's redirect list.
- **Live data.** A read-only GitHub App owned by the organisation reads issues, projects, actions and checks; its private key is a Worker secret, and the build mints a one-hour token from the same App to read the board. GitHub webhooks, whose signatures the Worker checks, refresh a KV document within seconds, and a cron every 15 minutes with conditional requests catches missed deliveries. CI posts coverage and conformance summaries authenticated by the GitHub Actions OIDC token, pinned to the issuer, audience, repository, branch `main` and workflow; no secret is stored for it.
- **The status page groups work by the `Product milestone` field,** in the field's option order, so reordering the board changes the page with no code change. Each planned decision record has a `type:decision` issue, and requirements appear under their issues' milestones. Decision and requirement status are build-time facts from the repository, published as `/data/repo.json`; issue, CI, coverage and conformance state are live. Each block shows the time its data is as of and falls back to the build-time snapshot.
- **The cutover.** On 2026-10-31 a Workers route `sluis.id/*` was switched on over the existing proxied DNS record, with no test hostname beforehand and no DNS gap; turning the route off is the rollback to GitHub Pages. `www.sluis.id` answers 301 to `sluis.id` by a redirect rule, before the Worker runs. An old address without its trailing slash gets the 404 page. Cloudflare's own build service, connected briefly before the cutover, was removed, together with its GitHub App. On 2026-11-01 both names moved from the route to Worker custom domains, in two applies with about 21 seconds of errors on the apex between them, and GitHub Pages was switched off.

## Consequences

- The site ships real security headers and server-side redirects at no cost for static traffic. A change is seen live only after it merges.
- Static traffic stays free only while no Worker runs first. A catch-all route or Workers Cache would put the whole site under the Free plan's daily Worker request limit, and over it Worker paths return 429 rather than fall back to the assets; every routing change must keep that in mind.
- The deploy needs a long-lived Cloudflare API token, because Cloudflare accepts no OIDC federation for deploys. Its scope (one Worker, no create or delete), its expiry and the `main`-only environment limit a leak, but anyone who can merge to `main` or edit a workflow that runs there can use it. A deploy that fails authentication is the reminder to rotate it.
- The deploy job rebuilds the site for the Worker, because the KV namespace id is written into the generated Worker configuration at build time from a secret only that job can read. One CI shows build and deploy together, and a broken deploy is a red check on the commit.
- The Worker holds two secrets, the App's private key and the webhook secret. The App is read-only, so a leaked key gives read access and nothing more.
- The server island needs a fixed `ASTRO_KEY`, so cached HTML can still decrypt its props after a redeploy; readers without JavaScript and crawlers see the snapshot.
- The status page changes when the maintainer edits the board, with no pull request; decision and requirement status change only by a merged pull request. Work without an issue on the board is invisible there.
- The static output, `_headers` and `_redirects` stay close to portable; the API (KV, cron, the adapter's bindings) is Cloudflare-specific.
- No product requirement follows: this is the project's own site, not something sluis does.

## Roads not taken

- **GitHub Pages only, rebuilt on events.** No security headers beyond a meta CSP, no server-side redirects, and freshness of minutes at best.
- **GitHub Pages plus a Worker on `/api/*`.** Two deploy systems, and headers patched on with zone rules instead of a file in the repository.
- **Cloudflare Pages.** The platform both Cloudflare and the Astro adapter are moving away from.
- **Full on-demand rendering on Workers.** Every request would be a billed Worker request, and `prerender: false` disables search; the docs change only on merge.
- **Another docs engine.** Each would mean rewriting the components, the explorers and the requirements pages, with no gain over Astro's content layer.
- **Cloudflare's own build service.** A second CI whose logs live in the dashboard, which deploys without waiting for the repository's checks and whose check links carry the account identifier.
- **A preview per pull request.** A preview hostname is a `workers.dev` name that carries the account subdomain; this can be revisited if previews on a hostname of the project's own zone become possible.
- **Resources created by wrangler on first deploy.** They would not be in reviewed code, and their ids would end up in the repository.
