# 0007 — Workload identity follows SPIFFE: proofs are exchanged for short-lived credentials, and hosts enrol the same way

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-11-01

Proposal: [issue #909](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/909).

## Context

sluis gives credentials to machines as well as to people: its own actors (an audit writer writing to a bucket, an actor calling one in another boundary), hosts that people log in to or that need a TLS certificate and the internal trust anchors, CI jobs holding their platform's token, and pods holding a ServiceAccount token.

v1 gave workloads an identity on its two platforms and exchanged it for tokens (v1 ADR 0030, on `master`). It had no story for hosts and never had to enrol a node of its own. v2 does: a board cluster replaces a node, a cloud instance starts with nothing but user data, a lab host has nothing but a person at its console.

SPIFFE is the published standard for workload identity: the ID format, the trust domain and its bundle, and the X.509-SVID and JWT-SVID documents. SPIRE is its reference implementation. sluis already holds what SPIRE would add: a CA under intermediates certified by a root that ritueel holds ([0013](/decisions/0013-the-hand-off-to-root-custody-and-the-signing-api/)), a policy engine ([0009](/decisions/0009-policy-is-cedar-in-a-rust-actor/)), a token issuer ([0006](/decisions/0006-identity-issuers-audiences-and-sign-in/)) and a node agent.

## Decision

### Proofs and the exchange

- **Every machine credential is obtained the same way.** The machine presents a proof from something sluis trusts, `exchange@<boundary>` verifies it in an RFC 8693 token exchange, and sluis returns a short-lived credential: a JWT-SVID, an X.509-SVID, an SSH certificate or a database client certificate ([0008](/decisions/0008-certificate-authorities-for-x509-ssh-and-databases/)), or cloud credentials through a cloud driver.
- **Machines use no OAuth client credentials.** A machine proves what it is; it holds no client secret. RFC 7523 JWT client assertions stay a possible middle ground.
- **Proof kinds are verifier drivers of `exchange`**, holding public material only: roots, key sets, a registry of known devices.

  | Milestone | Verifier driver | Proof |
  |---|---|---|
  | First working version | `github-oidc` | A GitHub Actions OIDC token (the signing API's callers). |
  | Parity | `aws-iid` | The EC2 instance identity document, accepted **once per instance**. |
  | Parity | `k8s-sa-token` | A projected Kubernetes ServiceAccount token. |
  | Parity | `yubikey-attestation` | A YubiKey PIV attestation chained to **Yubico Attestation Root 1** through Yubico's published intermediates, checked against a registry of known cards. sluis ships that root, because `piv-go`'s built-in roots reject attestations from firmware 5.7 and newer (spike, 2026-10-31). |
  | Parity | `enrol-token` | A single-use or reusable enrolment token. |
  | Parity | manual approval | A person approves the request in the console. |
  | Later | `tailscale-whois`, TPM | The Tailscale node identity of the caller's address; a TPM attestation. |

- **Renewal is by possession, with periodic re-attestation.** A machine renews with the credential it holds, over mutual TLS, and proves its original kind of proof again from time to time.

### SPIFFE identities

- **Followed now:** the SPIFFE ID, the trust domain and its bundle, the X.509-SVID and the JWT-SVID. **Later:** SPIFFE Federation, the Workload Endpoint and the Workload API. **SPIRE is not deployed**; sluis plays its parts (the mapping is on [Machine identity](/concepts/identity/)).
- **ID paths:**

  | Subject | SPIFFE ID |
  |---|---|
  | A host | `spiffe://<trust-domain>/host/<name>` |
  | A Kubernetes ServiceAccount | `spiffe://<trust-domain>/k8s/<cluster>/ns/<namespace>/sa/<sa>` |
  | A sluis actor | `spiffe://<trust-domain>/sluis/<actor>`, for example `spiffe://prod.example.com/sluis/ca` |
  | A CI job | `spiffe://<trust-domain>/ci/github/<org>/<repo>` |

- **An actor has one ID form.** The instance (a node or a unit) is a separate attribute: a DNS name in the X.509-SVID's subject alternative names, a claim in the JWT-SVID.
- **JWT-SVIDs come from the boundary's issuer:** `iss` is its URL, `sub` the SPIFFE ID ([0006](/decisions/0006-identity-issuers-audiences-and-sign-in/#subjects)).
- **Across boundaries, actors use mutual TLS with SPIFFE IDs.** A token for an actor in another boundary has that actor's SPIFFE ID as `aud`, and the target decides again with its own policy.
- **Actors on a node get a token each.** `sluis-node` reads the caller's uid from the peer credentials of its Unix socket, maps it to an actor, and issues that actor a short-lived workload JWT signed with the node's workload-issuer key, a key of its own that `signer`'s token-signing key never shares ([0012](/decisions/0012-cryptography-and-authority-keys/#the-card-slot-map)). The caller cannot name another actor.
- **One workload issuer per boundary.** Its key set holds one workload-issuer key per node, beside the token-signing keys. Per-node issuers are an option only for a fleet whose nodes run different sets of actors, where a cloud role can then trust only the nodes that run its actor.
- **A cloud driver exchanges the token for that cloud's credentials** (for example `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`), and the role's trust policy pins `sub` to the actor and its boundary.
- **Every actor uses its own credentials, and nothing mediates the data path.** sluis brokers credentials; it does not proxy data. The node's per-actor tokens, cloud token exchange, database client certificates and NATS credentials from sluis are all forms of this.
- **Where the platform gives an identity, sluis uses it:** the function's role on serverless; on Kubernetes the rules of [0018](/decisions/0018-runtimes-installations-and-delivery-order/#kubernetes).

### Trust domains

- **The trust domain is the boundary.** Each environment has its own trust domain, its own bundle and its own CA intermediate, because the boundary owns the keys ([0005](/decisions/0005-boundaries-and-the-isolation-ladder/)). A host of one environment does not trust another environment's SVIDs unless a connection between the boundaries is declared.

### Join cases

A host enrols with the same mechanism and receives a host X.509-SVID from `ca` under the host profile. A replacement sluis node enrols the same way; this is how a new member of a state cluster gets its identity ([0011](/decisions/0011-state-is-one-port-with-compare-and-set/)).

| Case | How | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| A. Manual approval | The host shows a short code; the approver sees the same code in the console. | Groups are assigned at approval. |
| B. Automation through user data | On EC2 the instance identity document, with no secret. Elsewhere a single-use token in the user data. | |
| C. Network | Tailscale WhoIs (Later). | A plain IP address only for a low-privilege identity, or with approval. |
| D. Reusable token | A number of uses, an expiry, bound groups, a name pattern and a pre-approved flag. | Shown once. |
| E. Hardware attestation | A YubiKey now, a TPM later. | |

- **Attributes keep their provenance.** What the verifier read from the proof is `attested`; what reviewed configuration says is `declared`; what an operator set in the console, audited, is `assigned`. What the host says about itself, and plain cloud tags, is `reported` and never grants anything ([0008](/decisions/0008-certificate-authorities-for-x509-ssh-and-databases/#ssh)).

### Host enrolment

- **The enrolment token never travels.** The client sends the token's ID and an HMAC, keyed with the token's secret, over its CSR and a nonce from the server.
- **The server keeps the HKDF-derived HMAC key, not the secret**, for single-use and reusable tokens alike. Like every state value it is encrypted under the sealing key's data keys ([0011](/decisions/0011-state-is-one-port-with-compare-and-set/#every-value-is-encrypted)), so a copy of the store alone cannot enrol a host.
- **Enrolment is encrypted end to end through the edge.** The trust bundle carries the boundary's enrolment public key in a certificate that the boundary's intermediate issues. The host encrypts its proof and CSR to it with HPKE (RFC 9180). The private key is its own purpose in `key-holder` or KMS ([0012](/decisions/0012-cryptography-and-authority-keys/#the-card-slot-map)), and `exchange` opens the request through the keys port. The edge sees only ciphertext.
- **The host pins the roots' public keys.** An SPKI-hash pin is mandatory at enrolment, except in manual approval, where the person compares the pin the host shows. Web PKI is kept for reachability and as an extra layer; it is not the trust.
- **The enrolment API** has start, poll, renew over mutual TLS, leave, and bundle. `entry` routes it and `exchange` carries it out.
- **Policy has four actions:** `host.enrol`, `host.renew`, `enrol-token.create` and `enrolment.approve`. Every enrolment, renewal, approval and refusal is audited, and a pending request notifies the people who may approve it.

### The trust bundle

- **The bundle is a static document of certificates in SPIFFE format, with no signature of its own.** Each certificate in it verifies itself: it chains through the boundary's intermediate to a root in the root list. The root list is signed by a root and published by ritueel ([0013](/decisions/0013-the-hand-off-to-root-custody-and-the-signing-api/#root-pins-and-the-root-list)), so an online signature over the bundle would add no trust.
- **The `sluis` package ships `sluis trust sync`**, a timer and a oneshot service ([0019](/decisions/0019-release-train-packaging-and-distribution/#packaging-per-runtime)). They do nothing until `sluis trust enroll --url <url> --root-pin <spki-hash>` configures them, with `--root-pin` given once per root. sluis generates no per-installation packages.
- **The sync checks every certificate and refuses rollback.** Each certificate in the bundle must chain through the intermediate to a root in the pinned root list, and one that does not is dropped; a root list with a lower version, or a bundle with a lower `spiffe_sequence` than the last one, is refused.
- **It writes the anchors and runs the system's tool** (`update-ca-trust` or `update-ca-certificates`). The unit is hardened and may write only the anchors directory and the extracted store.
- **On Kubernetes, trust-manager reads the bundle as a source.** sluis writes no Kubernetes object.

## Consequences

- One flow covers sluis's own nodes, hosts, CI and pods. A new kind of proof is a verifier driver with its own conformance tests, not a new flow.
- A replaced node needs no secret copied to it; on EC2 it needs nothing, and a copied identity document cannot enrol a second host.
- sluis runs no SPIRE server or agent and no second CA. The cost is implementing the SPIFFE formats itself, and workloads that want the Workload API wait for it.
- A host keeps working with its last good bundle when sluis is down, and a network attacker cannot roll it back. Rotating the enrolment key is a bundle change: a new certificate in the next bundle.
- One issuer per boundary keeps the cloud side small: one OIDC provider per boundary and one key per node, well inside AWS's limits of 100 providers per account and 100 keys per key set. The cost is that a compromised node can sign a token for any actor of its boundary until its key leaves the key set.
- The standards register lists the SPIFFE ID, trust domain and bundle, X.509-SVID and JWT-SVID as Full, Federation and the Workload API as Planned, and RFC 9180 for enrolment.
- Threats addressed: T-20, T-21, T-22, T-23 and T-24, see the [threat model](/security/threat-model/).

## Roads not taken

- **Deploy SPIRE.** Mature, with the Workload API today, but a second CA and root of trust beside ritueel's, an agent on every node and registration entries that repeat declared rules and Cedar.
- **Own formats instead of SPIFFE.** Every verifier and mesh would need sluis-specific code.
- **All of SPIFFE now.** A local endpoint for every workload before anyone needs it.
- **The installation as the trust domain.** Environments in one installation would share a trust domain; the trust domain follows the keys.
- **An issuer per node by default.** One provider and key set per node, and nothing gained where every node runs the same actors.
- **OAuth client credentials, or a local credential helper on a port.** A shared secret that works from anywhere, or credentials readable by every local process.
- **The enrolment token sent in the request, or TLS to the edge as the only protection.** Anything on the path, including the edge connector, could replay or read the proof.
- **Web PKI as the trust at enrolment.** Any public CA that issues for the sluis host name could stand in for sluis.
- **The trust bundle signed by a root.** A root would have to be online for every bundle change.
- **The trust bundle signed by an online bundle-signing key.** A bundle of certificates already verifies itself against the root-signed root list, so the signature adds no trust, and the key would be one more purpose, slot and policy.

## Follow-ups

None.
