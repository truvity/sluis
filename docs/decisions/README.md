# Architecture decisions

One record per decision that shapes this repository from the outside —
what a relying party must do, what an installation must accept, what a
release removes. The pages under [`concepts/sluis/`](../concepts/sluis/architecture.md) say
how the shipped thing works; a record here says why it is shaped that
way, what was weighed against it, and what follows from choosing it. When
the two disagree, the explanation pages describe what actually shipped and a
record here is read as the reasoning that got there.

A record is never edited to reverse a decision. A changed mind gets a new
record that supersedes the old one, so the index below stays a true
timeline and nothing is silently rewritten under an old date. The old record's
**Status** line (and the Status column below) is changed to say what overtook
it, so a reader of one record does not need to know another exists; its body
is not edited.

| [0027](0027-the-state-port-nats-jetstream-and-dynamodb.md) | The State port: NATS JetStream on Kubernetes, DynamoDB on AWS | Accepted; partly superseded (2026-10-04): the NATS JetStream half was removed, the DynamoDB half stands.

| [0028](0028-nothing-writes-configmaps-or-secrets.md) | Nothing writes ConfigMaps or Secrets; written secrets are sealed | Accepted; partly superseded (2026-10-04): sealing is retired, the rule that nothing writes ConfigMaps or Secrets stands; extended by [0034](0034-exports-go-to-openbao-directly.md); amended by [0036](0036-configuration-is-immutable-per-instance.md) |

| [0034](0034-exports-go-to-openbao-directly.md) | Exports: the service copies its secrets into OpenBao itself | Accepted; amended by [0041](0041-the-secret-contract.md) (proposed): the export copies, their schedule and the recovery bundles are retired; extends [0028](0028-nothing-writes-configmaps-or-secrets.md) and supersedes the part of an estate's GitOps ADR-034 §9 that says the issuer never calls OpenBao and a PushSecret copies |
| [0035](0035-renamed-to-sluis.md) | Renamed to sluis | Accepted; its NATS-bucket and `sluis:binding` rows are moot since [0027](0027-the-state-port-nats-jetstream-and-dynamodb.md) and [0028](0028-nothing-writes-configmaps-or-secrets.md) removed NATS and sealing (2026-10-04); the kept contract names still stand |
| [0036](0036-configuration-is-immutable-per-instance.md) | Configuration and policy are immutable per instance; credentials and State are read live | Accepted; amended by [0037](0037-one-process-everywhere.md); amended by [0071](0071-least-privilege-modules-one-credential-holder-per-function.md) (immutable per execution environment; AppConfig on AWS); amended by [0041](0041-the-secret-contract.md) (proposed): layout v3 becomes v4; refined by [0038](0038-estates-render-through-sluis.md); follows up [0007](0007-breaking-changes-inside-1x.md) (the deferred deprecation window), refines [0032](0032-one-configuration-file-one-binary-one-chart.md), amends [0028](0028-nothing-writes-configmaps-or-secrets.md) and [0031](0031-a-generic-migration-tool.md) only where they name SSM paths or configuration documents |
| [0037](0037-one-process-everywhere.md) | One process everywhere: one Lambda function, one Deployment, one service document | Superseded by [0071](0071-least-privilege-modules-one-credential-holder-per-function.md) (2026-10-09); was: Accepted; refined by [0038](0038-estates-render-through-sluis.md); amends [0036](0036-configuration-is-immutable-per-instance.md) (three documents and three Deployments → one unified process) |
| [0038](0038-estates-render-through-sluis.md) | Estates render their documents through sluis | Accepted; refines [0036](0036-configuration-is-immutable-per-instance.md) (who writes the documents an instance is started with) and [0037](0037-one-process-everywhere.md) (one service document, one policy document) |
| [0039](0039-the-issuer-generates-confidential-client-secrets.md) | The issuer generates confidential client secrets | Accepted; amended by [0041](0041-the-secret-contract.md) (proposed): the secret and its previous value live at `external/oidc/<client>`; extends [0038](0038-estates-render-through-sluis.md) (what an estate declares for a client) and refines the client table of the policy document |

| [0041](0041-the-secret-contract.md) | The secret contract: internal and external, one storage module, keys by purpose | Accepted (2026-10-08). Once carried out it amends [0034](0034-exports-go-to-openbao-directly.md) (the export copies, their schedule and the recovery bundles are retired), [0036](0036-configuration-is-immutable-per-instance.md) (layout v3 becomes v4) and [0039](0039-the-issuer-generates-confidential-client-secrets.md) (where a generated secret and its previous value live). Its companion [0042](0042-one-repository-one-release-train.md) moves audit into this repository and decides how audit is installed. |
| [0042](0042-one-repository-one-release-train.md) | One repository, one release train: audit moves into sluis and is installed by preset to destinations | Accepted (2026-10-08). Companion of [0041](0041-the-secret-contract.md), which decides secrets, storage, keys and deployment shapes for both products. |
| [0043](0043-record-schema-proto-with-json-schema-slots.md) | Record schema in Protocol Buffers with JSON Schema extension slots | accepted |
| [0044](0044-profiles-composed-from-framework-profiles.md) | Profiles composed from framework profiles, one copy per profile | accepted; the compliance bundle this record first called a preset is a *framework profile*, and the `profiles/` directory, the `frameworks:` key and the `profile` package carry that name (a *preset* is a named bundle of adapter or deployment choices, per truvity/policy decision 0012) |
| [0045](0045-s3-object-lock-as-the-record.md) | S3 Object Lock in compliance mode is the record; everything else is a projection | accepted; the object layout is superseded by [0060](0060-v1-bucket-layout.md), and retention is extended by [0065](0065-archive-retention-and-lifecycle.md) |
| [0046](0046-sink-interface-and-transports.md) | One sink interface at every hop; the queue is invisible | accepted; the delivery modes are superseded by [0054](0054-two-deliveries-and-a-durable-ack.md), itself superseded by [0059](0059-sink-durability-and-transports.md), which extends this |

| [0056](0056-lock-modes-and-store-tiers.md) | Lock modes and store tiers: the lock is demanded where a framework demands it | accepted; refined by [0068](0068-storage-is-configured-per-preset.md) (the lock is a property of the install preset's bucket, not a setting of the process) |
| [0057](0057-schema-ids-on-github-pages.md) | Schema identifiers on GitHub Pages, the old ones kept as aliases | accepted; the base moved to the sluis site by [0069](0069-schema-ids-move-to-the-sluis-site.md) |
| [0058](0058-three-parts-installed-independently.md) | Three parts, installed independently; the bucket layout is the contract | accepted; refines [0053](0053-one-installation-per-service-or-product.md) |

| [0063](0063-one-validated-configuration-file.md) | One configuration file, validated against a schema | accepted; refined by [0067](0067-configuration-is-immutable-per-instance.md); the secret fields it names (`<field>Env`) are `<field>Secret` through `secrets.source` in configuration version 2 (truvity/policy decision 0012; [upgrade](../guides/audit/upgrade/v0.13.md)) |

A consequence of [0042](0042-one-repository-one-release-train.md): audit's repository and its Pages site are retired. Amends [0057](0057-schema-ids-on-github-pages.md). |
| [0070](0070-cloudflare-tokens-and-r2-credentials-by-prototype-clone.md) | Cloudflare tokens and R2 credentials: sluis clones a disabled prototype token | Accepted (2026-10-08). Follows [0014](0014-minting-third-party-credentials-only-where-membership-is-governed.md) (a credential is minted only where membership is governed), stores its output under the contract of [0041](0041-the-secret-contract.md) and grants it to people and agents as [0040](0040-agent-class-sessions.md) sets out. |

Supersedes [0037](0037-one-process-everywhere.md) (one process everywhere); amends [0036](0036-configuration-is-immutable-per-instance.md) (immutability moves from the instance to the execution environment, and AWS configuration is delivered through AppConfig); builds on [0026](0026-two-platforms-permanently-kubernetes-and-aws-lambda.md), [0030](0030-workload-identity-on-both-platforms.md), [0041](0041-the-secret-contract.md) and [0042](0042-one-repository-one-release-train.md).

## Audit's records

The records numbered 0043 to 0067 are audit's, which had its own series
(0001 to 0025) before audit moved into this repository
([0042](0042-one-repository-one-release-train.md)). They were renumbered after
sluis's, in order, and are otherwise unchanged apart from the Status and Date
lines, which now use the shape the rest of this directory has. A reference to
"audit ADR NNNN" in an older changelog entry, issue or comment means the
record in this table.

## Template

Start a new record from this shape. Keep it tight — long enough to make
the reasoning checkable, short enough that the next reader finishes it.

```markdown
# NNNN — <a decision, stated as a decision>

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Accepted; amended by [NNNN](NNNN-slug.md) | Accepted; partly superseded by [NNNN](NNNN-slug.md) | Superseded by [NNNN](NNNN-slug.md)
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

The situation that made a decision necessary, and the constraint that
ruled some answers out before the rest were compared.

## Decision

What was decided, stated so a reader could act on it without reading
anything else. Include the shape of the mechanism, not just its name.

## Consequences

What this costs, what it forecloses, and what a relying party or an
operator must now do differently. Say the honest boundary out loud —
the case this decision does not cover — rather than leaving it to be
discovered.

## Alternatives considered

Each one named, with the specific reason it was not chosen. "We didn't
think of it" is a fine thing to be able to write here later; do not
retrofit reasons no one had at the time.
```

Use `refines`, `extends` or `amends` on the newer record, and add the matching
`amended by`, `refined by` or `extended by` to the older one's Status line only.
The older record's text is never edited.
