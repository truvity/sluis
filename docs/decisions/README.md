# Architecture decisions

One record per decision that shapes sluis from the outside: what a user must do, what an installation must accept, what a release removes.
A record says why the thing is shaped the way it is, what else was weighed, and what follows.
Explanation pages describe the target state and carry a status badge; a page marked `shipped` describes what shipped. When a page and a record disagree, the record is the reasoning and the page is fixed.

How a decision is made is in [GOVERNANCE.md](../../GOVERNANCE.md).

## Numbering

v2 numbering starts again at `0001`. `0000` is the [template](0000-template.md).
v1 had its own records on the `master` branch. Refer to them as "v1 ADR NNNN" and link to `master`, for example "v1 ADR 0007". Do not renumber them and do not copy them here.
A v2 record that replaces a v1 decision says so in its context.

## Files

A record is `NNNN-short-title-in-kebab-case.md`. A new record takes the number after the highest one in the index. A decision that is planned but not written has an issue and no number: prose names the issue, never a future number.

## Format

Every record has these parts, in this order:

- **Status.** One of `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Rejected`, `Superseded by NNNN`, or `Accepted; amended by NNNN`.
- **Date.** The day the status last changed.
- **Context.** The forces at play. What problem, what constraints, what the reader needs to know.
- **Decision.** What we do, in the active voice.
- **Consequences.** What gets easier, what gets harder, what must follow. Include costs.
- **Roads not taken.** Each other option that was weighed, one bullet each: the option in bold, then why it lost. This part is required.
- **Follow-ups.** The named tasks and planned records that follow, each with its issue, or "None.".

Under the status and the date, one line links the proposal issue: `Proposal: [issue #N](...)`.

## Rules

- **Never edit history** (after the first v2 release; the design phase below waives it until then). A changed mind gets a new record that supersedes the old one. The old record's status line changes to point at the new one. Its body stays.
- **Typos and links** may be fixed in place.
- **One decision per record.** Keep it short. A page of reasoning is better than ten. A rule is stated in one record; the others link to its heading.
- **Accepted means decided.** An `Accepted` record has no open part: it does not say "not decided here" or that another record will decide it. What it leaves out is under Follow-ups, with its issue. A record with an open part is `Proposed` and lists the part under Follow-ups.
- **Public means generic.** A record names no private deployment, account, hostname, ticket or person other than the maintainer. Use neutral examples.
- **Draft ADRs are internal.** Reasoning starts in internal discussion. Only the final record is written here, once the maintainer has decided.
- **Standards.** A deliberate deviation from a standard in the register needs a record.
- **Scope.** New product scope, and changes to the design model, need a record.
- **Links.** A link to a record uses the site path, `/decisions/NNNN-slug/` or `/decisions/NNNN-slug/#heading`. CI checks that every "ADR NNNN" and every such link names a record that exists, and that every anchor is a heading in it.

## Design phase (2026-10-29)

v2 is a clean start. During the v2 design phase, before the first v2 release, the maintainer may rewrite, merge and renumber records in place. The rule "Never edit history" above is waived for this period only. The earlier text stays in git history, and a rewritten record carries no history lines. After the first v2 release, records are append-only: a changed mind gets a new record, as the rules above say, and a number is never reused, even for a rejected record.

On 2026-11-01, before any code was written, the maintainer had the 32 records accepted until then merged into the 20 below and renumbered from 0001, so that each rule is stated once and no accepted record holds an open part. The old numbers and slugs are in [renumbered.json](renumbered.json) and in the table at the end; the site redirects each old address to the record that took it over.

## Where the old records went

The records before 2026-11-01, by their old number and slug. An "ADR NNNN" in an issue or a commit from before that day means the old number.
