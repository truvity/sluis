# 0044 — Profiles composed from framework profiles, one copy per profile

**Status:** accepted; the compliance bundle this record first called a preset is a *framework profile*, and the `profiles/` directory, the `frameworks:` key and the `profile` package carry that name (a *preset* is a named bundle of adapter or deployment choices, per truvity/policy decision 0012)
**Date:** 2026-09-17

## Context

Several frameworks apply to the same event at once: security operations,
usage billing, tenant-facing history, regulatory evidence, and add-ons such
as PCI DSS, DORA or healthcare access logging. They disagree on which fields
may be kept, how identities are treated, and for how long. A single store
with a single retention over-retains for one purpose and under-retains for
another, and lets a reader with one purpose see fields justified only by
another (see the regulation survey in this repository's history).

## Decision

A **framework profile** is a file under `profiles/` describing what one framework
requires: the core fields a copy must carry, the core fields it may carry,
the core fields it may never carry, the field classes of extension properties
it keeps, the PII levels it refuses, required event categories, identity
treatment per actor category, retention with a hot window, integrity
controls, review cadence, pipeline defaults, and the clauses it cites, with a
disclaimer. Where a framework gives no number the framework profile carries a defended
default marked configurable.

**A copy is default-deny.** A core field named by no framework profile of the profile is
dropped, and an extension property survives only if its class is one the
profile keeps and its PII level is not one the profile refuses. A copy
carries what its purpose justifies and nothing more, and adding a field to
the record does not quietly widen every copy of it. Forbidding a field
forbids everything beneath it.

A **profile** is a deployment's composition of framework profiles plus a destination.
Composition is a union resolved towards the stricter reading: the strictest
identity treatment, the longest retention, `required` over `recommended`, the
most frequent review. The validator refuses a profile whose framework profiles both
require and forbid a field, directly or through an ancestor, and a deployment
whose catalogues do not emit a category a profile requires. Composing the
security and billing framework profiles into one copy is refused for exactly this
reason: one must know who acted and the other must not, which is why they are
two copies rather than one with a compromise.

The split writer produces **one copy per profile**. Scalar fields are
copied into every profile that keeps them, and every copy carries the event
id and the SHA-256 of the original wide record, so that copies can be shown
to descend from one original once their identifiers differ.

Bodies are copied too, not referenced. Storing them once under a payload
prefix was the earlier reading, and it buys nothing with these profiles: the
only large field, `capture`, is kept by one profile. It would cost a
seven-year lock on every body, since a writer cannot know which profile will
reference a payload next and a lock can be extended but never shortened. See
[the split writer](../audit/explanation/split-writer.md) for the condition that would
change this.

Framework profiles reference core fields and classes only, never an application's
property, which keeps them framework-generic.

## Consequences

- Each prefix is one dataset with one purpose, one legal basis, one
  retention and one access role. An auditor or a data protection authority
  is pointed at exactly that prefix.
- After the security retention the actor, addresses and user agent are
  gone. The billing copy still holds tenant, time, action and quantity.
- Duplication multiplies a small core by at most the number of profiles.
  At the volumes surveyed that is tens of dollars a month.
- Enabling a framework profile per deployment is a versioned configuration change and
  emits `audit.profile.changed`.
- Applications never learn about profiles beyond tagging their actions.

## Alternatives considered

- **Store each field once, grouped by longest-retaining profile, join at
  read time.** No duplication, but joins that object storage cannot do,
  more complex exporters, and purpose bleed on shared groups. Revisit only
  at two orders of magnitude more volume.
- **Feature flags per field at the emitter.** Silent toggles defeat the
  requirement that starting, stopping or altering logging is itself
  logged, and a flag can drop a field a framework requires.
