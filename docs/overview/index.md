sluis is an open-source identity and access broker for people, robots and external systems. It sits between the identity providers that already know who someone is and the systems that need a credential before they let that someone in.

## Who it is for

sluis is for engineers who run the identity layer of a small organisation, a platform team or a self-hosted lab, and want it small, auditable and cheap to run.

- **Operators** install it on a workstation, on three single-board computers, as AWS Lambda functions or on Kubernetes. The same actors and configuration run on each; these four are the [tested installations](/runtimes/installations/).
- **Platform and security engineers** write the policy that says who may get which credential, and read the audit trail that says who did.
- **Integrators** add sign-in providers, directory sources and credential minters as separate processes, in any language that speaks ConnectRPC.

## What it does

- It **federates sign-in** from upstream identity providers, so people use the accounts they already have.
- It **issues OIDC tokens** and **exchanges tokens** (RFC 8693): a robot or a CI job presents a token from the system it runs on and receives a sluis token for the system it wants to reach.
- It **mints short-lived downstream credentials**, such as cloud credentials, GitHub installation tokens and certificates. Nothing it hands out is meant to outlive the task.
- It **reconciles directory facts** from workspace directories and GitHub teams, so that policy can say "members of this team" without sluis owning the team.
- It **writes a tamper-evident audit trail** of every success ([Audit](/concepts/audit/)).

The part that holds a key is small and parses no internet input, and the part that decides is separate from the part that signs ([Actors](/concepts/actors/)).

## What it leaves out

- **It is not a general secrets engine.** It keeps its own and its integrations' secrets and publishes a small typed set of credentials, but has no general key-value store, transit engine or lease system. Use a secrets manager for those.
- **It has no users of its own, holds no roots and writes no Kubernetes objects.** Roots belong to the sister product [ritueel](https://ritueel.id). The reasons are in [what sluis is, and is not](/principles/#what-sluis-is-and-is-not).

## v1 and v2

v1 is the sluis that runs today, a set of AWS Lambda functions on the `master` branch. v2 is a rewrite on `main` that shares no history with v1. v2 first reaches parity with v1 (the [features page](/features/) lists what that means); after parity it adds FAPI 2.0, and later CIBA, once a real consumer exists, in poll mode with a passkey on the approving device ([#980](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/980)). The two lines coexist until the maintainer's own deployments run v2 ([ADR 0001](/decisions/0001-v1-and-v2-lines/)). The order of delivery is on the [roadmap](/roadmap/); the v1 documentation is at [/v1/](/v1/).

## Map of the documentation

| Section | What you find there |
|---|---|
| [Design principles](/principles/) | The yardstick the decision records follow. |
| [Concepts](/concepts/) | The model and its vocabulary: actors, ports and drivers, boundaries, keys, identity, audit and data. |
| [Integrations](/integrations/) | Every system sluis connects to, and how to set it up. |
| [Architecture](/architecture/) | Context, components and deployment, and the permission manifest behind them. |
| [Security](/security/threat-model/) | The threat model and break-glass recovery. |
| [Runtimes](/runtimes/) | Bare-metal, serverless and Kubernetes, and the four tested installations. |
| [Tutorial](/tutorials/single-node-install/) | A step-by-step install on a single node. |
| [Distribution](/distribution/) | Packages, platforms and release signing. |
| [Standards](/standards/) | The specifications sluis follows and how conformance is proved. |
| [Decisions](/decisions/), [Roadmap](/roadmap/), [Project status](/status/) | The reasoning, the milestones and where the work stands. |

A badge beside each title says whether the page describes a design not built yet, something partly built or something shipped. Plain prose is the design; a **Proposed** note names the open issue that will settle it. The rules are in [Target-state pages](/contributing/pages/).
