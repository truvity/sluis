title: Pages and writing style
description: How a page of the sluis site marks what is built and decided, where a page lives, how big its diagrams may be, and how it is written.

The pages on this site describe the **target state** of sluis v2: what it is meant to be, until it is built. A page is not a promise that the thing exists, so it says how far it has got. The [writing style](#writing-style) below holds for everything in the repository, commit messages included.

## Where a page lives

Docs live next to the thing they describe: the format of the decision records is in `docs/decisions/`, the format of the requirements in `docs/requirements/`, and a page about a part of sluis sits in that part's section of the site. When the thing changes, its docs change in the same pull request.

A fact is stated once, on the page that owns it, and the other pages link there ([Design principles](/principles/), [How we design](/contributing/design/#state-each-rule-once)). State the design as plain fact and link the decision record for the reasoning; history stays in git and the records. v1 behaviour is described only on the [v1 parity checklist](/features/).

### Moving a page

Moving or renaming a page needs a line in the `redirects` map of `site/astro.config.mjs` in the same pull request, pointing at the final page. Without it the old address becomes a 404, and a link on another site breaks. Check after the deploy that the old address answers 301 to the new one ([After every deploy](/contributing/tools/#after-every-deploy)). A decision record that is merged or renumbered is recorded in `docs/decisions/renumbered.json` instead, and the redirects follow from it ("Design phase" in `docs/decisions/README.md`).

### Home pages

A home page, or the top of a section, starts from the reader's pain: what goes wrong for them today. Then comes the mission, then what the project does about each pain, with an honest status for each (designed, built, planned). It does not open with the architecture. Changes to the site's layout, home page, Worker or headers follow [Changing the site](/contributing/tools/#changing-the-site).

## Status

Every page has a required `status` in its front matter, shown as a badge next to the title and checked in CI:

| Status | Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `target` | Target state | Describes the design; not built yet. |
| `partial` | Partly built | Describes the design; part of it is built and part is not. |
| `shipped` | Shipped | Describes what has been built and released. |

The status also starts the page in `llms.txt`. Change it in the pull request that builds the thing. When a page and a [decision record](/decisions/) disagree, the record is the reasoning and the page is fixed.

## Asides

How settled a point is shows in how it is written:

- Plain prose is **decided**.
- `:::note[Proposed]` is for a point that is really undecided, and it links its open tracking issue.
- A proposed note with no issue is either written as plain text, when the point is decided, or deleted, when nothing needs it.
- A plain `:::note` or `:::caution` is a warning to the reader, not a status.

```md
:::note[Proposed]
Each node agent holds its own signing key ([#NNN](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/NNN)).
:::
```

## Diagrams

Mermaid diagrams (a ```` ```mermaid ```` fence) are drawn at their natural size; a wide one scrolls in its box, and **Expand** opens it fullscreen with pan and zoom. A diagram that needs the zoom to be read is too big; keep it to a size a reader takes in at a glance:

- At most about 6 participants in a sequence diagram.
- Short labels, on nodes and on messages: a few words, not a sentence. Put the detail in the text beside the diagram.
- Split a big flow into several small diagrams, each with a heading and a line of prose.
- Prefer `flowchart LR` for a wide flowchart, with a few nodes per column, over `TB` with a long row.

## Writing style

Write for an engineer who has not followed the discussion.

### Plain and short

- Say the verdict first, then the reasons.
- Use plain words and short sentences. Prefer the active voice: "the writer seals the batch", not "the batch is sealed".
- Use a table to compare options, versions or numbers, not a paragraph.
- One idea per paragraph. Cut a word that adds nothing.

### Dated and checkable

- Date every claim that can rot: a measurement, a version, a price, the state of an upstream project. "Measured 2026-10-31" lets the next reader judge it.
- Name the version of a tool or a standard when the claim depends on it.

### Instructions

- In guidance for people and agents, prefer soft wording ("prefer", "avoid") and say why. Keep "never" and "must" for the rules that have no exception, such as secrets and the public-content rules.
- Write steps as numbered lists in the imperative.

### Files

- Use the `.yaml` extension for YAML files, not `.yml`. The exceptions are the file names a tool requires: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` and `.yarnrc.yml`. `just check-yaml-ext` checks it.
- After an edit, reflow the paragraph you changed so it keeps the wrapping the file already uses.
- Text files use LF line endings; `.gitattributes` enforces it.
