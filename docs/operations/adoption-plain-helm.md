# Adopting it with plain Helm

Nothing in sluis assumes a GitOps controller. The `sluis`
chart is an ordinary OCI Helm chart, every value an installation needs is in its
own values file, and every Secret it reads is one the installation creates. This
page installs the issuer with `helm install`, signs in for the first time, and
says how to take new releases without ArgoCD or Kargo. Every name below is a
placeholder: `example.com` for your domain, `eu-example-1` for your region.

The `access-proxy` chart was removed in v1.32.0
([ADR 0003](../decisions/0003-deprecate-access-proxy.md)): on Envoy Gateway,
gateway-native OIDC replaces it and needs no chart of ours; for any other
gateway, run upstream oauth2-proxy yourself (step 4).

## Prerequisites

| Needed | For | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes | the issuer | the issuer's recovery sign-in asks the API server to review a ServiceAccount token, so it runs in the cluster it trusts |
| cert-manager, and a `ClusterIssuer` | the issuer | two certificates: the **signing key** (by default from a `ClusterIssuer` named `selfsigned`; only the key is used) and the TLS certificate for its Gateway (`route.certificate`). Or deliver the signing key yourself and set `signingKey.existingSecret` |
| Gateway API, and a controller that serves a `GatewayClass` | the issuer's route | the chart renders a `Gateway` of `route.gatewayClassName` and two `HTTPRoute`s. With `route.parentRefs` it attaches to a parent you already have and renders no Gateway. Without `route.host` it renders no route at all, for a trial by port-forward |
| Envoy Gateway | gateway-native OIDC for consoles (optional) | a `SecurityPolicy` with an `oidc:` block (`gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1`); see [../connect/console-app.md](../connect/console-app.md) |
| a Valkey (or any Redis-protocol store) | the issuer with more than one replica | the chart does not install one. One replica of the issuer may run without it (`replicaCount: 1`, `valkey.address: ""`), keeping sessions in memory |
| a Google Workspace, and an OAuth client in a Google Cloud project | people signing in, and the directory the groups are read from | the one upstream that is built; a second directory backend (Entra) is designed and not written. [connect-runbook.md](connect-runbook.md) walks through the client |
| an audit installation ([truvity/audit](https://github.com/truvity/audit)) | the audit trail (optional) | without `audit.writer` nothing is kept beyond the log line every record also is, and the service says so at start. This service writes no object itself: the installation owns the archive |
| OpenBAO, or a Vault with the same API | short-lived SSH, database and client certificates (optional) | not installed by these charts; [../connect/openbao.md](../connect/openbao.md) |

## Install order

1. **Valkey**, from whatever chart you already use.
2. **The Secrets** the values will name. The issuer holds no RBAC to read
   a Secret through the API; each one is mounted as a file.

   ```sh
   kubectl create namespace access-issuer
   kubectl -n access-issuer create secret generic access-issuer-google-client \
     --from-literal=client-id=<google client id> \
     --from-literal=client-secret=<google client secret>
   # one per confidential client in the policy, key client-secret
   kubectl -n access-issuer create secret generic dashboard-oidc-client \
     --from-literal=client-secret=<a long random string>
   ```

3. **The issuer.** One tag releases every artifact here; pin the charts
   at the same version.

   ```sh
   helm install sluis oci://ghcr.io/truvity/charts/sluis \
     --version X.Y.Z --namespace access-issuer --values issuer-values.yaml
   ```

   ```yaml
   config:                                    # `sluis serve`'s configuration file, as it stands
     issuerURL: https://access.example.com    # stable for the life of the installation
     release: sluis                   # the release's full name
     publicRootURL: https://access.example.com
     publicURL: https://access.example.com/console
     valkey:
       address: valkey.access-issuer.svc:6379 # two replicas share sessions here
     oauthClient:                             # keys client-id and client-secret
       secretName: access-issuer-google-client
       idFile: /var/run/access-issuer/oauth-client/client-id
       secretFile: /var/run/access-issuer/oauth-client/client-secret
     console:
       client: access-console
     audit:                                   # optional; see the prerequisites
       writer: http://audit.example-ns.svc:8080        # the installation's receiver
       queryURL: http://audit-query.example-ns.svc:8080 # its query service, for the Audit page

   secretMounts:
     - secretName: access-issuer-google-client
       mountPath: /var/run/access-issuer/oauth-client

   route:
     host: access.example.com
     rootRedirect: /console/
     gatewayClassName: example-gateway-class  # a GatewayClass your controller serves
     certificate:
       issuerName: example-ca                 # a cert-manager issuer you own
       issuerKind: ClusterIssuer

   policy:
     groups:
       all:access-roster:operator:
         members: [platform-admins@example.com]
         matchers:
           # the recovery account: how the first operator gets in
           - service_account: { namespace: access-issuer, name: access-issuer-recovery }
       all:access-roster:viewer:
         matchers: [{ email_domain: example.com }]
       all:dashboard:viewer:
         members: [everyone@example.com]
     clients:
       access-console:
         kind: public
         display_name: sluis
         redirects: [https://access.example.com/console/]
         requires: [all:access-roster:operator, all:access-roster:viewer]
       dashboard.example.com:                 # a console's client: its id is the proxied host
         kind: confidential
         secret: dashboard-oidc-client        # key client-secret, in the issuer's namespace
         display_name: Dashboard
         redirects: [https://dashboard.example.com/oauth2/callback]
         signed_out: [https://dashboard.example.com/]
         requires: [all:dashboard:viewer]
   ```

   The policy is the whole of who may do what; its format is
   [../reference/policy.md](../reference/policy.md), and every value is
   in [../reference/configuration.md](../reference/configuration.md). A
   malformed policy fails the rollout, not a sign-in: the previous pods
   keep serving.

4. **For a console that has no OpenID flow of its own**, use the gateway's
   native OIDC support — declare a `SecurityPolicy` with an `oidc:` block
   ([../connect/console-app.md](../connect/console-app.md)). The
   `access-proxy` chart was removed in v1.32.0
   ([../decisions/0003-deprecate-access-proxy.md](../decisions/0003-deprecate-access-proxy.md)).
   If your gateway is not Envoy Gateway, run upstream `oauth2-proxy`
   yourself following the recipe in
   [../design/access-proxy.md](../design/access-proxy.md).

Both values files above render with the charts in this repository
(`helm template` with `--namespace` as shown), and the policy loads.

## First sign-in

Nobody can sign in through the directory until a directory is connected,
and it is connected from the console. The way in before that is the
**recovery sign-in**: a short-lived ServiceAccount token that the API
server vouches for, which the policy above puts in the operators group.

```sh
kubectl -n access-issuer create token access-issuer-recovery \
  --audience access-issuer-recovery --duration 10m
```

Open `https://access.example.com/login` (or port-forward the Service's
port 8080), expand **Recovery sign-in**, and paste the token. The
console's Overview then lists what is left: connect the Google Workspace
by admin consent (the OAuth client needs the two redirect URIs
`https://access.example.com/connect/google/callback` and
`https://access.example.com/login/google/callback`), and check that your
own directory group lands you in the operators group. Sign out, sign in
as yourself, and search for yourself: your page shows the membership
that granted each group. Who may mint a recovery token is the cluster's
RBAC on `serviceaccounts/token` for that one account
([runbook.md](runbook.md#day-one)).

**Controllers.** `githubRoster.enabled` and `slackRoster.enabled` are both off by
default, and a GitHub organisation or Slack workspace they know is a dry run
until listed in `policy.controllers.github.enabledOrgs` / `policy.controllers.slack.enabledWorkspaces`; see
[the runbook](runbook.md#enabling-a-slack-workspace).

From there each connection is one guide: a
[cluster](../connect/kubernetes-cluster.md), an
[AWS account](../connect/aws-account.md),
[GitHub Actions](../connect/github-actions.md), a
[laptop](../reference/sluisctl.md).

## Without ArgoCD or Kargo

ArgoCD and Kargo appear in these docs as **relying parties** — consoles
that sign in against the issuer ([argocd.md](../connect/argocd.md),
[kargo.md](../connect/kargo.md)) — not as the way to deploy it. With plain
Helm:

- **Pin one version** and keep the values files in your
  own repository. The policy is values, so a change of who may do what is
  a reviewed change to that file followed by `helm upgrade`; the pods
  roll on a policy change by checksum.
- **Take a release through the zero-diff gate** ([../adoption.md](../adoption.md)):
  render the pinned version and the new one with your values and compare.

  ```sh
  helm template sluis oci://ghcr.io/truvity/charts/sluis \
    --version OLD --namespace access-issuer -f issuer-values.yaml > old.yaml
  helm template sluis oci://ghcr.io/truvity/charts/sluis \
    --version NEW --namespace access-issuer -f issuer-values.yaml > new.yaml
  diff -u old.yaml new.yaml
  ```

  An image tag and the version labels move on every release; anything
  else in the diff should be a line of [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md).
  Then `helm upgrade` with the same values.
- **Back up what the console adds.** Five Secrets, and the Slack state if the
  Slack controller is used (`<release>-slack-credentials`,
  `<release>-slack-records`, `<release>-slack-catalogue-apps`;
  `slackState.push` copies the first two), hold everything that cannot be
  minted again; with no controller copying them, copy them yourself
  ([restoring from the Secrets alone](../reference/configuration.md#restoring-from-the-secrets-alone),
  [Slack state](runbook.md#slack-state)).
- **Adopting objects that already exist.** Moving an issuer
  that was installed another way into this chart is the same gate:
  choose the release name and values so the render reproduces the live
  objects' names, and make the switch one change whose diff is empty.
  Moving from another identity provider is
  [migration-from-an-idp.md](migration-from-an-idp.md).
