# Runbook

Day-two operations. Everything here is visible in the console; a shell is
needed for the export, a restore, and reading the log lines of an
installation with no audit trail connected.

## Day one

**A deployment that declares its own way in has no day one.** Values that
carry a workspace and a non-empty operators group are signed into through
the directory from the first boot. Nothing below applies; go to
[the connect runbook](connect-runbook.md) when you add the next tenant.

**A standalone installation configures itself through the console**, and
the console leads it. Overview shows what is left to do until nothing is,
with this installation's own values to copy rather than a placeholder to
translate — the redirect URI is its hostname, and that is where a day-one
setup goes wrong.

1. Install. The service generates `Secret <release>-session-key` and creates
   the ServiceAccount `<release>-recovery`. There is no password anywhere.
2. Mint a recovery token — a cluster administrator already has the RBAC
   for this, and granting `create` on `serviceaccounts/token` for that
   account is how you give it to somebody else:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n access-issuer create token <release>-recovery \
     --audience <release>-recovery --duration 10m
   ```

3. Port-forward the service's port (or go through the gateway), open
   `/login`, expand **Recovery sign-in** and paste the token.
4. Follow Overview. It walks the four steps: register an OAuth client with
   the directory, give it to the service, connect the first directory, and
   attach a directory group to the operators group. Each disappears as it
   completes.
5. Sign out; sign in with the directory as yourself. Search for yourself:
   your page shows operator and the membership that granted it.

Outside a cluster there is nothing to prove access to, so the service prints a
generated recovery password once at start and step 2 is reading it off the
log (on AWS Lambda it is a parameter instead, see
[Recovery on Lambda](recovery-on-lambda.md)). That installation gets a fifth setup step — turn the password off —
because a stored password *is* a standing credential, which the token is
not.

Step 4's first item is the only one that leaves the console:
[the connect runbook](connect-runbook.md) has the full walk-through of the
cloud-console visit, and Overview has the two values to paste into it.

The console signs people in as a client of the issuer it shares an
origin with, so steps 3 and 5 are the issuer's own sign-in page, and
recovery stays reachable by port-forward.

## Lost operator access

Nobody is in the operators group, or the group was renamed, or the directory
sign-in is what is broken:

- **recovery enabled (the default):** mint a token as in day one, sign in
  at `/login` under *Recovery sign-in*, fix the membership. Who did it is
  in the service's log and in the cluster's audit log, by name.
- **recovery disabled:** set `config.recovery.enabled: true` (with `config.inCluster: true`) in the values,
  roll the deployment, then as above. There is no password to recover,
  only RBAC to hold.
- **`503 recovery could not be checked`:** the check did not run — the API
  server is unreachable, or the service may not create TokenReviews (the
  ClusterRole `<release>-<namespace>-tokenreview`). It is not a wrong
  token; do not go looking for one.
- **`401 that proof was not accepted`:** the token expired (they are
  minted for minutes), was minted for another audience, or belongs to an
  account that may not recover. Mint another with both flags.
- **outside a cluster, `429 too many attempts`:** ten wrong passwords stop
  the password answering for a minute — the correct one included, so that
  the limit is not a hint about which guess was close. Wait, then try
  once.

Sessions are stateless signed cookies. To log everyone out at once,
delete `Secret <release>-session-key`; the service generates a new one on restart.

The console's own sign-out is the issuer's `/logout`, which ends the
sign-in and every session under it. A console behind `access-proxy`
has a cookie of the proxy's instead, and its sign-out has to run the
whole chain — the proxy's `/oauth2/sign_out`, then the issuer's
`end_session` with that console's client id, then back to its front
page; the proxy chart builds it. With only the proxy's half, the issuer
keeps the session and the next click at any console signs them straight
back in, which looks exactly like success. The issuer's client must
list the console's front page in `signed_out`, or the person lands on
the issuer's own page instead.

Recovery, for the record, is the **cluster anchor used as the floor**
([../design/trust.md](../design/trust.md)): the issuer depends on the
directory, the directory is what this section assumes is broken, so the
only thing left to trust is the API server.

## What "unhealthy" means and what to do

| Symptom (console) | Cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Health: error, domains *provisional — probe failed* | token revoked, admin suspended, tenant policy changed, scopes withdrawn | **Reconnect** (consent) or upload a new key. Nothing is lost meanwhile: the last snapshot is served, non-authoritative |
| Health ok, domains *provisional — snapshot stale* | refresher cannot complete a full read (a page fails, quota, timeouts) | check the service logs for the failing page; **Refresh** to retry now; the snapshot recovers on the next successful pass |
| Health ok, domains *provisional — first snapshot pending* | the workspace was connected moments ago, or its served list was just changed; the first snapshot runs detached | wait — seconds for a small tenant, a minute or two for a large one. Longer than a refresh interval: read the log for the failing page |
| One replica answers *workspace not found* for a directory the other serves | before 0.8 the reader map was filled only at start, so a workspace connected on one replica was unknown to the other | restart the replica; from 0.8 a missing reader is opened from the stored credential on first use |
| The consent callback shows the CDN's own *Bad gateway* page | the service answered 5xx and the CDN replaced it — since 0.7.2 the callback never answers 5xx, so the request did not reach the service | the gateway, the route, or the egress policy; the service's log has nothing because nothing arrived |
| One domain not authoritative on two workspaces, marked *conflict* | both tenants list the domain **and both serve it** — a move in progress, or a misconfiguration | wait for the move to complete, or narrow one of them: *Choose which to serve* on the directory's page, leaving the domain out of the tenant that should not answer for it |
| A domain shows *not served* | this service was narrowed to a subset of the tenant's domains, so nothing routes to it and its accounts are not cached | intended in most cases; *Choose which to serve* changes it. A declared workspace says so in the values (`directory.workspaces[].serve`) |
| A domain shows *no longer owned* | the served list names a domain the directory no longer lists — it has moved to another tenant | the hand-over already happened: the other workspace serves it as soon as its own discovery returns it. Drop the entry here so the list matches reality |
| Every domain non-authoritative at once | Valkey unreachable | restore Valkey; the service refills it within one refresh interval |
| A workspace shows *declared* and no Reconnect/Disconnect | it comes from the chart's overlay | change the deployment's values, not the console |
| After a restart, a workspace is unhealthy with "no backend: the credential is not loaded" | its entry in `Secret <release>-workspace-credentials` is gone or unreadable — restored namespace without that Secret, hand-edited object, an entry deleted by hand | put the Secret back from a backup — then **restart**, because the credential is read once ([Rotating](#rotating)) — or **Reconnect** (consent) or upload the key again. The record, its served domains and its synced groups are intact; only the credential is missing. The service logs the workspace id at start |

The rule consumers follow makes every row above safe: **a
non-authoritative answer holds, it never removes.**

## A controller release that crash-loops

**What happened, 2026-10-04.** The rollout of sluis 1.57.0 on kernel crash-looped
every pod at start. The service (`serve`) kept its old pods, because it runs two
replicas under `RollingUpdate`, so sign-in stayed up. The GitHub and Slack
controllers were fixed at one replica with `strategy: Recreate`: their old pods were
deleted first, so both controllers were down for about 15 minutes, until the fix was
rolled. Nothing was lost (every pass recomputes from the console and the target
system), but nothing was reconciled for that time either.

**What the chart does now.** Each controller's Deployment rolls with
`maxUnavailable: 0` and `maxSurge: 1`, with a readiness probe on `/readyz`
(`probes.address`, default `:7070`), and `minReadySeconds: 10`. The new pod becomes
Ready only after it has finished starting: the policy loaded, the stores open and
the audit catalogue accepted. A pod that crashes at start never listens, so it is
never Ready, and the rollout stalls with the old pod still running. The symptom is
then a Deployment that does not complete, not an outage.

**Reading a stalled rollout.**

```sh
kubectl -n <ns> rollout status deploy/<release>-github-roster --timeout=120s
kubectl -n <ns> get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=<name>-github-roster
kubectl -n <ns> logs <the new pod> --previous
```

The old pod is the one that is Running and Ready; the new one is `CrashLoopBackOff`
or `Running` and not Ready. Its log names the refusal. The ones seen: the audit
installation refusing the catalogue (`the audit installation refused the catalogue`:
the catalogue version the binary carries is newer than the audit installation
accepts, which is what 1.57.0 hit, fixed in 1.57.1 by moving to the `roster 1.7.0`
catalogue), a policy the binary refuses, or `enabledOrgs` / `enabledWorkspaces`
naming something the policy does not bind. Fix the cause and roll again; **do not
scale the old Deployment down or delete its pod** to "make room", which is the
`Recreate` outage by hand. Argo CD reports the Deployment as Progressing until the
`progressDeadlineSeconds` (ten minutes) passes, and then as Degraded; the old pod
keeps running throughout.

**Alert on it.** A controller that is down, or that ticks and fails, is visible
in the series the controllers emit on every tick: see
[telemetry](telemetry.md#the-controllers-and-the-rails).
`access_roster.tick.last_success_timestamp` (per `kind`, `target`) is the one to
alert on for a controller that has stopped; the chart's `AccessRosterTickStale`
([SluisTickStale](telemetry.md#sluistickstale)) ages it. The series is **absent**
when a controller has never ticked, and after a day of silence, so an alert on a
controller that is gone for good needs `absent_over_time(...)` beside it.

**More replicas.** With a shared State a controller may run two replicas, so a node
loss does not pause reconciling: see
[high-availability](high-availability.md#the-controllers-how-they-roll-and-when-a-second-replica-is-safe).

## Backing up, and restoring, what the console holds

Everything a console added that cannot be minted again is in five
Secrets in the service's namespace, each under a name a deployment
knows in advance:

| Secret | Holds |
|---|---|
| `<release>-workspace-credentials` | every console-connected workspace's credential, one key per workspace, with a copy of its record |
| `<release>-github-apps` | every connected organisation's App key and the link App's client, each with a copy of its record |
| `<release>-github-links` | people's GitHub links, tokens included |
| `<release>-github-runner-apps` | every runner App, its record beside its keys |
| `<release>-github-catalogue-apps` | every catalogue App, its record beside its keys |

**Back them up** by copying the five objects into a secret manager that
travels with your backups. The chart renders the copy for the two that
nothing upstream can re-deliver: `directory.push` writes the whole of
`<release>-workspace-credentials` and `githubApps.push` the whole of
`<release>-github-apps`, each an External Secrets `PushSecret` of the
entire Secret under one remote key, off until written
([values](../reference/configuration.md#values)). The other three are a
`PushSecret` of your own. Nothing in the service depends on the copy,
and what lands in the store **is** the credential — name a store the
installation already trusts with material of that weight.

**On a State adapter** (`ports.adapter` other than `legacy`) there are no such
Secrets: the credentials are in the Secrets port, and the service copies the five
bundles into OpenBao itself, entry for entry as the Secrets held them, with
`exports` of `source: bundle` ([Exports](../reference/configuration.md#exports-and-the-export-port)).
The copy is made at start, within seconds of a change and every hour; it is never a
dependency, and a failed one is the alert `SluisExportFailing`
([telemetry](telemetry.md#sluisexportfailing)). To restore from one, read the key
(`bao kv get`, [0013](../decisions/0013-openbao-access-through-the-bao-cli.md)), write each entry of its JSON object back as a key of the Secret
of that name, and proceed as below. The service does not read an export back: the
Secrets port is the source of truth, and a lost Secrets store is
what the copy is for.

**Restore** by putting the five Secrets back into the namespace, with
the labels they carried, before the service starts or before restarting
it. At start it rebuilds every workspace ConfigMap and every GitHub
record that is missing beside a credential, then reopens the
workspaces. A restored workspace shows as never probed until its first
probe; a link token that rotated since the copy means that person links
again; a declared Secret is re-delivered by whatever declared it.
**Restoring from a backup is a rotation** and needs the same restart
([Rotating](#rotating)): writing the good value back is not enough on
its own.

**Without a copy**, a lost workspace credential is recovered by pressing
**Connect** again as the same admin role account — the tenant id matches
and the domains return authoritative after the first snapshot — and a
lost App by *Disconnect* then *Create* on the App's page, on the GitHub page's Apps tab.

A namespace that ran a release before 1.7 still holds one
`<release>-credential-<tenant>` Secret per workspace beside the new one:
start-up copied each in by name and left the old object for a rollback,
and reconnecting or disconnecting that workspace removes it.

### Slack state

Slack keeps its state in two Secrets and a ConfigMap, none of which anything
upstream can re-deliver:

| Object | Holds |
|---|---|
| `Secret <release>-slack-credentials` | each connected workspace's client id and secret, and its bot token once installed |
| `ConfigMap <release>-slack-workspaces` | each workspace's record (`<workspace>.json`), the Slack Connect channels defined on the console (`_shared.<name>.json`), the ordinary console channels (`_channel.<workspace>.<name>.json`), and transient confirmations (`_confirm.*`) and pass markers (`_pass.*`) |
| `Secret <release>-slack-records` | a mirror of the records above, exactly the `<workspace>.json`, `_shared.*` and `_channel.*` entries, kept by the service in the same code path that writes the ConfigMap. It exists because a `PushSecret` reads Secrets only |

`slackState.push` copies the two Secrets, each whole under its own remote
key (`remoteKey` for the credentials, `recordsRemoteKey` for the records),
with `deletionPolicy: None`. The status ConfigMap `<release>-slack-status`
is derived and is not copied. What lands in the store **is** every
workspace's credential, so name a store the installation already trusts.

**Restore** after losing the namespace:

1. Put both Secrets back before the service starts, with the labels they
   carried (`app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=directory-roster`,
   `app.kubernetes.io/part-of=<release>`, and
   `access-roster.truvity.github.io/kind` of `slack-workspaces` for the
   credentials and `slack-records` for the records). Either an
   `ExternalSecret` that pulls each remote key into the Secret of that name
   (`dataFrom: extract` of the remote key), applied once and deleted after,
   or a one-off: read each remote key from the store and write its entries
   as the Secret's keys. Do not leave a pulling `ExternalSecret` in place:
   the service is the writer, and a pull would let a stale copy overwrite a
   freshly connected workspace.
2. Start (or restart) the service. If the records ConfigMap is missing or
   holds no record and the `slack-records` Secret has some, start repopulates
   the ConfigMap from it, and logs the restored keys. A ConfigMap that has
   records is never added to, because a record missing from it may have been
   removed on purpose; the mirror is brought up to date with it instead.
3. The Slack controller needs no restart: it notices the restored credentials
   and records within 30 seconds (the kubelet may take up to about a minute to
   project the Secret and the ConfigMap into the pod) and passes straight away.
   Each workspace shows as never probed until that first pass. Confirmations and
   pass markers are not restored: re-confirm any pending removal set.

Both copies are needed: the records say which workspaces are connected and
carry the console channel and Slack Connect definitions, the credentials let
the controller act.

**Without a copy of the Slack state**, press **Connect** again for each
workspace (a new throwaway configuration token, a new App, an owner installs
it): the team must match the one recorded at the first install, which is lost
with the records, so the first install after a total loss records the new team.
Console channel and Slack Connect records, and each workspace's owner, are lost
and must be re-entered; channels in Slack are untouched.

## Cutover: migrating an installation

Moving an installation from Kubernetes (the `legacy` adapter: ConfigMaps, Secrets and
Valkey) to the AWS hybrid preset (DynamoDB for State, SSM for secrets, S3 for the
controllers' reports) is one command, `sluis migrate`, run from an operator workstation
with AWS credentials and kube access (the mechanics and the report are in
[migrate.md](migrate.md); the decision is ADR 0031). The legacy objects are never
changed or deleted, so the rollback is to scale the old Deployments back up.

**What moves.** The State records (every key, value and lifetime; a record that has
expired is not copied); the secrets the domain stores keep (a workspace credential, an App
key, a link's token pair, the console's session key), written to the Secrets port under
`credentials/<kind>/<id>/<ref>` (storage layout v2); the controllers' last reports, to S3; and the issuer's **key ring
schedule** (`issuer:keyring:*`, the tombstones of retired keys included), so that the old
file key's public half stays published through its overlap and a token issued before the
cutover keeps verifying. **What does not move.** The issuer's sessions, refresh tokens,
codes in flight and Index sets (people sign in again: it is the one visible effect), and
`issuer:kms:state-secret-fingerprint` (the new installation's secret differs, and a stale
fingerprint would stop it from starting).

**Before the window.**

1. Write the destination `serve` configuration (`new.yaml`): `ports.adapter: dynamodb`
   with the table and region, the `ssm` secrets adapter with its root, `ports.blob` with
   the bucket. Keep the legacy file (`old.yaml`) as the Deployment reads it, with
   `valkey.address` pointing at a `kubectl port-forward` to the Valkey, so that the key
   ring can be read.
2. For the cutover's Lambda configuration set `signingKey.activationDelay` to its minimum,
   equal to the poll interval (for example `30s`). The old file key's signer is not on
   Lambda, so the new KMS key signs only after the delay; token requests fail closed until
   then. Expect about 30 to 60 seconds with no new tokens right after the switch.
3. **Dry-run against the live installation.** It reads everything, converts, validates and
   writes nothing, and needs no freeze:

   ```
   sluis migrate --from old.yaml --to new.yaml \
     --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config --kube-context <context> --namespace <namespace> --dry-run
   ```

   The summary on stderr counts items and bytes per concern (state, secrets, blobs) and
   lists what the destination would **refuse**: a record over the State limit (256 KiB,
   inside DynamoDB's 400 KB item), a credential over the Secrets limit (8 KiB), an invalid
   key. Anything refused makes the exit status non-zero, in the dry run and in the real
   run; `--overwrite` does not override it. Fix what it names (or, for a record that is
   truly dead, delete it) and dry-run again until it exits 0.

**In the window.**

4. **Freeze.** Scale the issuer, the console and both controllers to 0 and wait until the
   pods are gone. Sign-in is down from here until the switch.
5. **Run.**

   ```
   sluis migrate --from old.yaml --to new.yaml \
     --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config --kube-context <context> --namespace <namespace> \
     --i-have-stopped-writers
   ```

   It is idempotent: it creates what is absent, leaves what is already equal alone, and
   after a failure the same command completes the copy. If the destination already holds a
   **different** (possibly newer) value for a key, the run stops before writing anything and
   names the key; pass `--overwrite` only when the source's value is the one to keep.
6. **Verify counts.** The run reads both sides again; the report must say `ok: true`, and
   `totals.verified` equal to `totals.source` less the refused (none). Compare the
   `concerns` counts with the dry run's. Run `cmd/acceptance` against the API Gateway URL.
7. **Switch.** Point DNS at the new origin. People sign in again; a token issued before
   the cutover still verifies. The first tokens come after the activation delay (step 2).
8. **Afterwards.** Leave the Deployments at 0 and the ConfigMaps, Secrets and Valkey as
   they are until the new installation has been healthy for as long as you want a rollback
   to stay cheap.

**Rollback.** Before the switch: scale the old Deployments back up; nothing on the legacy
side was written. After the switch: point DNS back and scale the old Deployments up. The
legacy data was never deleted, but it does not have what the new installation wrote since
the switch; to carry that back, stop the new writers and run `sluis migrate` the other way
round with `--overwrite` (see migrate.md, Rollback).

## Rotating

**The Secrets and ConfigMaps are a projection, not a live source.**
Nothing in the service watches them: writing a new value into one
rotates nothing on a running pod. Which ones need a restart differs, so
the rule is per object, as `charts/sluis/values.yaml` states it:

> `workspace-credentials` — RESTART. The credential is read once, when
> a replica first opens that workspace — at start, or at the console's
> connect ceremony. After that the open reader is held in memory and
> the Secret is never read again. The only thing that drops a reader is
> DISCONNECTING the workspace, which also revokes the credential and
> deletes the snapshot: that is removal, not rotation.
>
> `session-key` — RESTART. Read once while the stores are wired.
> Deleting it is the documented "sign everyone out" lever, and it takes
> effect on the restart, not on the delete.
>
> `github-links` (App) — NO RESTART. The record and its credential are
> read from the API on every use, so a rotated value is picked up by
> the next request.
>
> The silence is the hazard: a rotation that has not taken effect looks
> exactly like one that has, until a restart hours or weeks later picks
> up the new value — or, if the written value was wrong, takes the
> directory down at a moment nobody connects to the change. Measured on
> 2026-09-21: a deliberately corrupted credential went unnoticed for 14
> minutes of normal operation, probes and a successful directory read
> included, and would have gone unnoticed indefinitely.
>
> TO ROTATE a workspace credential or the session key: write the value,
> then restart the Deployment, then confirm from the logs that the new
> value was read ("opened a workspace this replica had not seen" for a
> workspace). RESTORING FROM A BACKUP IS A ROTATION and needs the same
> restart — writing the good value back is not enough on its own.

Per credential:

- **Consent credential:** Reconnect. The old refresh token is revoked at
  Google as part of it, and the replica that served the click opens the
  new reader; every other replica holds its old one, so restart the
  Deployment and confirm from the log.
- **Service-account key, connected through the console:** Upload key
  again with the new JSON; the old one is replaced. Then the same
  restart, for the same reason.
- **Service-account key, declared:** replace the named Secret and
  restart the Deployment — the mounted file is read once, when the
  workspace is adopted at start, and never re-read. Delete the old key
  in Google Cloud only after the log shows the new one was read.
- **OAuth client secret:** update the declared Secret and restart. The
  console cannot set it — `SettingsService` has `GetSettings` and no
  `SetOAuthClient`, because a credential a console can change is one
  somebody can change from a browser — and the sign-in half reads the
  two mounted files once at start. Existing refresh tokens keep working;
  the secret is used only to exchange and refresh.
- **Slack bot token:** press **Connect** on the workspace (a reinstall; a
  configuration token is needed only when the roster's scopes grew). The new
  token is written to `<release>-slack-credentials`; the controller reads it
  within about two minutes and passes straight away, no restart.
- **Catalogue Slack App:** reinstall from the Apps tab; a consumer of a
  `slackApps[].push` copy reads the new value from the store when External
  Secrets refreshes it (default 1h).
- **Session key:** delete `Secret <release>-session-key` and restart;
  the service mints a fresh one, and everyone signs in again. Never copy
  it anywhere: there is no `session.push`, deliberately.

## Export

```sh
kubectl -n access-issuer get secret,configmap \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=directory-roster -o yaml > sluis-export.yaml
```

The export contains credentials. Treat it as one.

## Scaling and cache

Two replicas are the default; the shared Valkey makes them answer from
the same snapshot and lets one refresher run for both. A single replica
may run without Valkey (`config.valkey.address` unset), at the cost of a cold
cache on every restart. Memory in Valkey is the size of the directories.
Every replica serves every workspace: one connected through the console
on the other replica is opened from its stored credential on first use
*(0.8; before that, only a restart taught a replica about it)*.

## Logs

Structured JSON on stdout. The service never logs a credential, a token or a
key file, and never logs the members of a group; it logs workspace ids,
domains, counts, durations and errors.

### Reading the groups-scoping report

With `config.groupsScoping: report` (the default since 1.32.0), every minted
token that would have dropped a group under
[per-audience scoping](../reference/policy.md#groups-in-a-token-scoping)
logs one INFO line naming the audience, the client, the subject and the
dropped group names — and mints the token exactly as it does today either
way. Nothing is enforced yet; the line exists so an installation can find
out what enforcing WOULD change before it ships.

Filter for the line's message (`"groups scoping"`) and group by
`audience`. Each distinct audience that appears is a client or a resource
whose consumers read a group beyond what its own `requires` names — the
same gap [the `Unconsumed` lint's known limitation](../reference/policy.md#groups-nothing-consumes)
has always named, now with the exact groups instead of a guess. For each
one:

- if the dropped groups are read by that audience's own relying party
  (a console mapping a role, a workload reading a claim beyond
  membership), add a `groups:` override to its policy row — `groups: [thing, ...]`
  for the specific things it needs, or `groups: all` to keep today's
  shape while you work out which;
- if an audience logs a large, stable dropped set for every subject and
  nobody can say why, that is usually an unused permission a caller was
  never meant to see — the report finding it is the feature working, not
  a bug to route around with an override;
- an audience that appears in NO finding at all is one whose tokens
  already carry exactly what scoping would keep, and needs nothing before
  a future release can turn `enforce` on for it.

Run report for long enough to see every audience an installation actually
serves — including anything on a slow cycle, like a monthly job's token
exchange — before treating its silence as complete.

### Turning enforce on

`config.groupsScoping: enforce` narrows a token's `groups` claim, and
`/userinfo`'s answer, to exactly what the report above described —
nothing about how `requires` gates entry, or how a `rung:` group shortens
a token's life, changes: both still read the FULL set a caller holds,
before scoping ever narrows what the token SAYS. See
[per-audience scoping](../reference/policy.md#groups-in-a-token-scoping)
for the rule itself.

It is opt-in: the chart's default stays `report`, and turning enforce on
for one installation never turns it on for another. Set it only once
report's findings for every audience this installation serves have each
been read and either accepted (an audience whose dropped groups are truly
unused) or given a `groups:` override.

**Finding a role that went missing.** A relying party that used to read a
group from a token and stops seeing it once enforce is on is the one
regression this mode can cause, and it has one fix: add a `groups:`
override to the audience's policy row (`groups: [thing, ...]` for the
specific things it reads, or `groups: all` to restore today's shape while
you work out which). To find out WHICH group went missing without
guessing:

1. Set the issuer's log level to DEBUG. Enforce logs the identical line
   report used to log at INFO — same message shape, same `audience`,
   `client`, `subject` and `dropped` fields, same rate limit — just one
   level down, because a dropped group is the steady state under enforce
   rather than news on every token.
2. Reproduce the failure, and read the line naming that audience and
   subject: `dropped` is exactly the groups the token stopped carrying.
3. Add whichever of them the relying party actually reads to a `groups:`
   override on that audience's row, and roll the policy out: a policy
   change is a new instance (a rollout on Kubernetes, a new configuration
   layer on Lambda).

### `/userinfo` is scoped too

Enforce narrows `/userinfo`'s answer by the presented ACCESS token's own
audience, the same computation as the token itself — a caller cannot
recover the unscoped list by calling `/userinfo` instead of reading the
token, which would otherwise be exactly the bypass scoping exists to
close.

## Enabling a Slack workspace

The controller is described in [Connect a Slack
workspace](../connect/slack-workspace.md).

**Before the first step:** the policy declares the workspace under
`slack.workspaces.<key>`, the controller's ServiceAccount is in
`all:access-roster:viewer`, `controllerSlack.enabled` is true, and the console is
rolled out before the controller (it needs `ListServedDomains`, 1.42.0).

1. Connect and install the workspace, list nothing in `policy.controllers.slack.enabledWorkspaces`,
   and let a pass run. The report's `tick.outcome` is `dry-run` and its rows are
   what enabling would do; read the held and retrying rows and the leavers.
2. Add the workspace's key to `policy.controllers.slack.enabledWorkspaces` and roll out. Its changes
   appear in the audit trail as `roster.slack_*`.
3. To stop, remove the key. Nothing is undone. That is also the emergency stop.

**Connect and Refresh.** Connecting is on the console: SYSTEMS, Slack,
Workspaces, **Connect** (paste an app configuration token from
api.slack.com/apps; it expires in 12 hours, is used once and is never stored or
logged), then an owner of the Slack workspace approves the install. The install
starts a pass without waiting for the interval: the controller looks at the
credentials every 30 seconds, and the kubelet may take up to about a minute to
project a changed Secret into the pod, so allow up to two minutes. Until a
report newer than the connection exists the page says *Installed - waiting for
the first pass*. **Refresh** on an installed workspace asks for a pass now (one
request per minute per workspace; *Pass requested* shows until a newer report
exists). Saving a console channel or Slack Connect record does not start a
pass; it waits for the interval or for Refresh. A callback Slack sends that is
refused (wrong team, a missing cookie) is logged and audited as
`roster.slack_workspace.connect_refused` or `roster.slack_app.install_refused`,
and the token is revoked.

A workspace not yet connected, or created and not yet installed, reports
`waiting` with no error. A workspace reported `failed` says why: a bot token
that belongs to another Slack team than the one recorded at the workspace's
first install, an owning directory that cannot be read or is no longer connected
(set another owner on the console), a Slack read that was not whole, or a
console answering under another policy (tried again within seconds; it clears
when the rollout ends). The rows of the last good report are kept under it. A
workspace with no owning directory is not a failure: every person is held *no
owning directory: set the owner on the console*.

**Holds and their reasons.** What the Slack area shows as *held*, each with its
reason and none an error: no Slack account yet (shown as *waiting for them*),
an account of another workspace, a bot, a deactivated account, no address in the
owner's served domains, *no owning directory: set the owner on the console*, a
channel whose visibility differs from the declared or recorded one (never
converted), an archived channel (never unarchived), a private channel with that
name the bot cannot see (*invite the bot to it*), a private channel the bot is
not in, a Slack Connect guest not yet connected or not accepted, *defined in
both git and the console*, and a console record whose sources are no longer
allowed (*the console channel's record is refused and not acted on*). A guest
account is reported, never invited or removed.

**The breaker.** It trips when a pass would remove more than half of a channel's
managed members, or more than half of the workspace's. The report carries a
fingerprint of exactly that set. **Confirm** (operator of the owning directory or
installation-wide) names that fingerprint; one confirmation satisfies every gate
the set covers; it lapses after 24 hours and a different set needs confirming
again. Confirmations are recorded as `roster.slack_removals.confirmed`.

**The audit actions**, in one list so an operator can search them:
`roster.slack_channel.created|adopted|archived`,
`roster.slack_member.invited|removed`, `roster.slack_shared.invited|accepted`,
`roster.slack_action.held`, `roster.slack_leaver.reported`,
`roster.slack_removals.confirmed`, and the console's
`roster.slack_workspace.connected|owner_changed|connect_refused|disconnected`,
`roster.slack_app.created|installed|install_refused`,
`roster.slack_shared_channel.created|updated|deleted` and
`roster.slack_console_channel.created|updated|deleted`.

**The guest-side probe.** The controller asks a connected workspace about a Slack
Connect channel (`conversations.info`) only for a channel a console record
manages, and only the sides the record names (host and `with`), or the
workspaces Slack names as guests when it names any. The expected answers
(`channel_not_found`, `not_in_channel`: a private side the bot is not in) are
logged at DEBUG; real errors warn; each pass logs one `guest-side probe` line
with `probed`, `visible` and `invisible`.

A removal over half of a channel or of the workspace is held with a fingerprint;
confirm exactly that set to let it go, once, within 24 hours. A person gone from
the directory who is still in a channel shows under *leavers* and is removed by
nobody on that account alone.

The controller needs egress to `slack.com:443`, which the chart does not open.

## Enabling a GitHub organisation

1. The organisation is bound in the policy, **connected** on the GitHub
   page, and the controller runs with the organisation *not* in
   `policy.controllers.github.enabledOrgs`. The **link App** is created, and the people
   who belong in it have linked their accounts — send them the link page
   the GitHub page shows. Until somebody links, their rows say
   `not linked` and their accounts are left alone.
2. Read its section on the GitHub page after a pass. *Controller* says
   `dry run`; the table of people not synced is exactly what enabling it
   would do. Look for anybody you did not expect to be removed, and for
   held rows: each carries its reason. *Controller* says `waiting on
   links` when the only thing left is people who have not linked — that
   is not in sync, and enabling changes nothing for them.
3. Add the login to `policy.controllers.github.enabledOrgs` and roll out. The next pass
   acts; its changes appear in the audit trail as `roster.github_member.*`.
4. To stop acting in it, remove the login again. Nothing is undone: the
   organisation is simply left as it is.

If a pass fails, the section says why — an organisation not connected,
an App GitHub refuses, a console that did not answer. A failed pass
changes nothing, and is reported over the last report that had rows, so
the page does not blank while passes fail. A console that answers under
a different policy than the controller loaded — the two restart at
different moments during a rollout — is the same: the pass changes
nothing. It is tried again within seconds rather than next interval,
because the difference usually lasts only until the last replica on the
previous policy has gone: after 5 seconds, then twice as long each time,
up to a minute, six times. A difference that outlasts those retries is not
a rollout — check that every console replica runs the policy the
controller logged at start (`policy` on "the GitHub controller is
assembled") — and the pass, with its retries, comes round again each
interval.

**Needs you on a GitHub organisation:**

- *Not enough seats* — buy the seats the banner names in the organisation's
  billing on GitHub. Nobody is invited past the last free seat.
- *Seats cannot be counted* — the organisation's App lacks organisation
  administration (read). An owner adds it in the App's settings on GitHub
  and accepts it for the installation. An App created from 1.5.0 on asks
  for it already.
- *Removals held* — more than half the organisation would leave in one
  pass. Read the removals; if they are right, press **Confirm**
  (`roster.github_removals.confirmed` in the audit trail). If they are a policy
  mistake, fix the policy: the set changes and the confirmation would not
  cover it anyway.

**Importing github-roster 0.x pairings.** Once, from a machine that can
read `/roster/people/*` in SSM: build `records[]{login, emails[],
approved_by, approved_at}` and call `ImportGitHubLinks` with `origin:
"github-roster 0.x"` as an operator. Every skipped record comes back with
its reason; imported ones show as *imported* on the GitHub page.

**A link that is `unverifiable`** can no longer be checked and was not
said by GitHub to be gone: its token pair was lost in an interrupted
renewal, or the link App was replaced. It adds and removes nobody. Ask
the person to open the link page and link again.

**A link that is `lost`** was withdrawn on GitHub — the work address
removed or unverified, or the authorization revoked — and its account
left the organisation (`roster.github_link.lost`, then
`roster.github_member.removed` in the audit trail). Linking again brings it back in on the next pass.

## Runner Apps

The chart declares the tiers (`config.github.runnerTiers: [preview, stable]`)
and the GitHub page's Runners tab then shows a row per bound organisation
per tier. *Create* is the same two clicks as an organisation's App:
GitHub's create page, then its install page, by an owner of the
organisation. The App lands in `Secret <release>-github-runner-apps` as
`<tier>.<org>.github_app_id`, `.github_app_installation_id` and
`.github_app_private_key` — the keys a gha-runner-scale-set
`githubConfigSecret` reads — and a deployment copies those three to its
runners, for example with a `PushSecret`. Until the App is installed the
key sits under `<tier>.<org>.pending_private_key`, so a copy taken in
between never replaces working runners with an App they cannot register
with.

| Symptom | Means | Do |
|---|---|---|
| a row reads *created, not installed* | the owner stopped after Create | *Install* on the App's page |
| runners stop taking jobs after a Disconnect | the App was uninstalled and its keys forgotten, as Disconnect does | create a new App for that tier and hand its keys to the runners |
| the runners' copy is empty | the App is not installed yet, or the copy runs before the keys exist | install it; the three keys appear only then |

## Audit: what happened lately

sluis keeps no audit trail of its own. It records into an **audit
installation** ([truvity/audit](https://github.com/truvity/audit)) of its
own, rendered beside it in the same namespace: `audit.writer` and
`audit.query` in the chart. What it records is its
catalogue, [`internal/audit/catalogue/roster.yaml`](../../internal/audit/catalogue/roster.yaml):
sign-ins and their refusals — at the issuer and at the console's own door,
recovery as its own action — token exchanges and GitHub installation tokens
by the kind of proof, refused refreshes, sign-outs and revokes, directory
connects and changes, GitHub Apps created, installed and disconnected, and
what the GitHub controller did to memberships and links; Slack workspaces
connected, owned, refused and disconnected, Slack Apps, console and Slack
Connect channel records, and what the Slack controller did to channels and
members.

The installation locks, indexes and signs; retention is its profile's
(`security`, every action, people in clear), not a setting here. Its own
documentation is where to go for the archive, verification and legal
holds.

**The console's Audit page** is the installation's view, shown when
`audit.query` is set. The console forwards the page's calls to the query
service with a token it mints for the person signed in (audience
`audit.audience`), so what anyone sees is decided by the installation's
grants — with the `access-roster` grants preset, groups named
`<scope>:audit:<role>` — and every read is itself recorded there. The policy
must declare the client `audit.audience` names, requiring those groups;
somebody it does not admit is told the page is not theirs. A recovery
sign-in has no address and cannot read the page.

**Every record is also one log line** with `"audit":true`: `audit.id` (the
record's id, which finds it in the installation), `audit.action`,
`audit.outcome`, `audit.actor.kind`, `audit.actor.id`, `audit.subject.id`,
`audit.targets.N` and `audit.reason`. With no installation connected, the
lines are all there is:

```sh
kubectl -n access-issuer logs deploy/access-issuer --since=24h | jq 'select(.audit == true)'
kubectl -n access-issuer logs deploy/access-issuer --since=24h \
  | jq -c 'select(.audit == true and ."audit.outcome" == "denied") | {time, action: ."audit.action", who: ."audit.actor.id", why: ."audit.reason"}'
```

**Where a record came from**, for one a request caused, is its context: the
client address, the user agent, the gateway's `X-Request-Id` and the trace.
The address is the connection's peer unless `audit.forwardedForTrustedHops`
is set, and then the `X-Forwarded-For` entry just left of that many of the
deployment's own proxies, read from the right. Count the proxies that
append: behind an edge that appends the client and a gateway that appends
the edge's connector, it is 1.

**The GitHub controller and the Slack controller each record for
themselves**, with their own service account's token, and the installation
stamps each as those records' observer. All three service accounts
(`<release>`, `<release>-github-roster`, `<release>-slack-roster`) must be mapped
to the source `roster` in the installation's `workloadIdentity.workloads`.

### Connecting an installation

1. Deploy the installation and give it the deployment document its
   profiles come from; see its deploy guide.
2. Map this release's service account, and each controller's when it runs,
   to the source `roster` in its `workloadIdentity.workloads`, with the
   audience `audit.token.audience` (default `audit`).
3. Declare a client for the page in the policy — its id is
   `audit.audience`, default `audit` — requiring the groups that may read
   the trail, and trust this issuer in the query service's grants file
   with that audience.
4. Set `audit.writer` and `audit.query`. At start the service registers
   its catalogue on the writer's own address; `audit installation connected`
   in the log says it did on the first try, `audit catalogue registered`
   that a retry did.

### Changing what is recorded

An audit installation keeps every catalogue version it was sent and refuses a
different document under a version it already holds, which stops the service
(and the controllers) at start: this is what v1.41.0 and v1.42.0 did, fixed in
v1.42.1. So any change to `internal/audit/catalogue/roster.yaml`, even one new
action, needs: (1) a new `version` in the file (the current version is 1.6.0);
(2) the released document saved as
`internal/audit/catalogue/testdata/released/roster-<version>.yaml` (a copy of the
file as shipped); (3) `just audit-catalogue`, which validates the document,
fails on an action emitted and not declared (or the reverse) and regenerates
`frontend/src/auditSentences.ts` (commit the result; the recipe fails on a
diff). `TestAReleasedCatalogueVersionIsNeverChanged` fails if a catalogue
carrying a released version differs from its fixture. An installation connected
to this release accepts the new version at start; roll the audit installation's
grants and `workloadIdentity` only if a new source was added.

### When the installation cannot be reached

**Nothing but a recovery sign-in waits for it.** Every other record goes on
a bounded queue inside the process and is retried with backoff until the
writer takes it; an outage is a delay, and the queue's depth is the signal.
The queue is in memory, so a pod deleted while the writer is down loses what
it held, and past the queue's bound the oldest are dropped and counted. The
log line every record also is remains either way. This is fail-open by
decision: an audit outage must not become an access outage.

**A recovery sign-in fails closed.** Its catalogue entry says `block`: it is
kept by the installation before the sign-in succeeds, and when it cannot be,
the sign-in is refused — a page at the issuer, a 503 at the console's own
door — and the refusal is recorded the ordinary way. The proof was good;
bring the writer back and recover again. There is no override. With no
installation connected at all, recovery is not refused: a deployment that
keeps no trail has nothing to wait for.

**An installation that cannot be reached at start** does not stop the start:
records wait in the queue, and the catalogue's registration is retried until
it answers. **An installation that refuses the catalogue stops the process**,
whether it refuses at start — the start fails, with the problems it gave —
or first answers after an unreachable start, which ends the process the same
way rather than leaving it running for the life of the pod with records
nobody accepts. `just audit-catalogue` finds most refusals before a release
does. **A token the installation does not trust** is said at Error, naming
the token file, and retried: it is a configuration to fix, and until it is
the queue fills and, past its bound, drops.

**The signals**, in the log:

| Line | Means |
|---|---|
| `audit installation connected` (Info) | the address answered |
| `audit catalogue registered` (Info) | it accepted this service's catalogue; records are kept |
| `the audit installation could not be reached; records wait in the emitter's queue, and registration is retried` (Warn) | started unregistered |
| `the audit installation refused the catalogue; records will not be kept until it is fixed` (Error) | the catalogue and the installation disagree; the process ends |
| `the audit installation does not trust this workload's token; …` (Error) | the writer answered 401 or 403: the token file, its audience, or the installation's `workloadIdentity` |
| `audit records could not be delivered yet` (Warn) | the writer refused or could not be reached; the queue holds them |
| `audit record not kept` (Warn) | one record: a `block` record the writer would not take, and the request it was for was refused |
| `audit record dropped and is not in the trail` (Error) | the queue gave one up; its `audit.id` names the Info line that reads as kept |
| `an audit record does not satisfy the catalogue` (Error) | a bug: the code built a record its catalogue refuses |
| `no audit installation is connected: records are validated and logged, and kept nowhere else` (Warn, at start) | the deployment keeps no trail |

and as metrics, from the emitter, pushed over OTLP when
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set on the pod: **`audit.emit.records.dropped` is the one to
alert on** — the queue gave up and those records are gone.
`audit.emit.queue.pending` climbing and not falling is a writer gone too
long; `audit.emit.batches.failed`, `audit.emit.records.refused` (a bug) and
`audit.emit.records.written` are the rest.
