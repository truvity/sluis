# Connect a console

**Anchor:** the issuer — a console is for people. If the same service
also has an API that workloads call, that API is a second listener on the
other anchor: [service-to-service.md](service-to-service.md).

A web UI with a service API, behind the gateway, with two roles. What you
write, what you deploy, what you never implement.

## Two shapes, and which one is yours

|  | gateway-native OIDC | its own flow |
|---|---|---|
| **Use when** | the console has no authorization model of its own, or is not yours to change, and it sits behind Envoy Gateway | you are writing it, and it needs identity *inside* itself |
| **Who runs the login** | the gateway's `SecurityPolicy`, which forwards a verified bearer | the console: it sends a browser to `/authorize` and reads what comes back |
| **You deploy** | your chart plus a `SecurityPolicy` — no chart of ours | your chart |
| **The client is** | confidential: the gateway holds the secret | public, with PKCE — no secret to rotate |

**Gateway-native OIDC is the default for a console with no authorization
model of its own, on Envoy Gateway** — a `SecurityPolicy` with `oidc:`
against a declared client, gated by that client's `requires`, nothing of
ours in front
([ADR 0001](../decisions/0001-sessions-and-an-absolute-limit.md)).

Write your own flow (the right column above) when the console needs
identity *inside* itself: per-user authorization from `groups`, per-user
audit, or tokens of its own to call something else.

**For a gateway that is not Envoy Gateway**, use upstream `oauth2-proxy`
yourself — see [docs/design/access-proxy.md](../design/access-proxy.md)
for the recipe. The `access-proxy` chart was removed in v1.32.0
([ADR 0003](../decisions/0003-deprecate-access-proxy.md)).

See [choosing-native-or-gateway-oidc.md](choosing-native-or-gateway-oidc.md)
for the decision between the two paths and [envoy-gateway-oidc.md](envoy-gateway-oidc.md)
for the `SecurityPolicy` itself, with its traps.

**A third shape exists and is not yours**: a console the issuer itself
serves, mounted on the issuer's own origin. It signs in as a client of
the issuer and then reads the SSO session directly rather than redeeming
the code, because the process holding the session is the one serving the
page. That is the directory console, and it is a property of that pair
rather than a pattern to copy. The directory console's areas (Overview,
IDENTITY, ACCESS, SYSTEMS with GitHub and Slack, ADMIN) are described in
[the design](../design/sluis.md#the-console) and in
[Slack](slack-workspace.md) and [GitHub](github-organisation.md).

## What you write

- **Backend in Go**: wrap everything in `identity.Middleware(issuer)` and
  put `identity.Require("all:myconsole:operator")` on the routes that
  need it. `Middleware` establishes and `Require` refuses — separate,
  because a health endpoint and a landing page run before anybody is
  established. Serve `identity.WhoAmI(version)` at
  `identity.WhoAmIPath`, which is what the frontend asks.
- **Backend in Node**: the same three pieces from
  `@truvity/sluis/server` — `middleware(issuer)`,
  `requireGroups(...)`, and `whoami(version)` at `whoamiPath`, answering
  the same body Go does. Connect-style, so Express and Nest on Express
  take them as they are.
- **Frontend**: `useIdentity()` and `<UserBadge/>` from the TypeScript
  package, `@truvity/sluis` on GitHub Packages
  ([installing it](../reference/typescript.md)). Views in the URL
  fragment, dist embedded in the binary.
- **Nothing else**: no login page, no session, no token parsing, no
  sign-out logic — and no signing-algorithm setting. Both verifiers accept
  what the issuer's discovery document advertises, so they follow the
  installation's key (ES384 with the chart's default, RS256 with an RSA
  key set at `signingKey.certificate`, e.g. `{algorithm: RSA, size: 2048,
  encoding: PKCS1}` for an installation whose other relying parties need
  RS256 — [reference](../reference/configuration.md)).

```go
issuer := &identity.Issuer{URL: "https://access.example", Audience: "myconsole.example.internal"}

mux := http.NewServeMux()
mux.Handle(identity.WhoAmIPath, identity.WhoAmI(version))
mux.Handle("/admin/", identity.Require("all:myconsole:operator")(admin))

http.ListenAndServe(":8080", identity.Middleware(issuer)(mux))
```

```ts
import express from "express";
import { Issuer, middleware, requireGroups, whoami, whoamiPath } from "@truvity/sluis/server";

const issuer = new Issuer({ url: "https://access.example", audience: "myconsole.example.internal" });

const app = express();
app.use(middleware(issuer));
app.get(whoamiPath, whoami(version));
app.use("/admin", requireGroups("all:myconsole:operator"), admin);
```

Either way the caller carries `name`, `givenName` and `familyName` beside
the address and the groups, read from the access token. A console that
shows who is signed in has no userinfo call to make.

There is no `authz` package: role helpers over `Verified` are designed
and not built ([../reference/go-module.md](../reference/go-module.md)).
`Require` is what exists, and it takes the group names as the policy
spells them — the name in the policy is the name in the token is the name
in the check.

## What you deploy

For gateway-native OIDC on Envoy Gateway, use a `SecurityPolicy` of the
gateway's own (see [envoy-gateway-oidc.md](envoy-gateway-oidc.md)).
For a gateway that is not Envoy Gateway, run `oauth2-proxy` yourself
(see [docs/design/access-proxy.md](../design/access-proxy.md) for the
recipe; the `access-proxy` chart was removed in v1.32.0).
For your own flow in the console, your chart alone and no proxy at all:

A platform that publishes its listeners as a `ListenerSet` is attached
to with `parentRefs` written out in full — `group`, `kind`,
`name`, `namespace` — in your gateway's configuration.

Your console keeps **its own hostname**. The one exception in the family
is the directory console, which shares its issuer's hostname under
`/console/` so that its session pages are same-origin with the issuer —
the third shape above, and a property of that pair rather than a pattern
for yours.

and the policy that puts people in those groups and admits them to the
client — the group's **name** is the value in the token, so name it what
the console checks:

```yaml
groups:
  all:myconsole:operator: { members: [myconsole-admins@example.com] }
  all:myconsole:viewer:   { members: [everyone@example.com] }
clients:
  myconsole.example.internal:
    # For gateway-native OIDC or upstream oauth2-proxy: `kind:
    # confidential`, the gateway/proxy holds the secret. Running your own
    # flow in the browser: `kind: public`, no secret, redirect is your
    # own callback.
    kind: confidential
    secret: myconsole-client
    display_name: My Console            # what the sign-in page says: "Sign in to continue to My Console"
    description: the team's dashboard  # one line under it; both are shown to anyone who starts a sign-in
    redirects:  [https://myconsole.example.internal/oauth2/callback]
    signed_out: [https://myconsole.example.internal/]
    requires:   [all:myconsole:operator, all:myconsole:viewer]
    # backchannel_logout_uri: https://myconsole.example.internal/backchannel   # only a console running its own flow can take one
```

`display_name` and `description` are what the sign-in page shows in
place of "the application that sent you here", which is what every
phishing page also says; keep them free of anything a stranger should
not read. A console running its own flow may opt in to back-channel logout with
`backchannel_logout_uri`; gateway-native OIDC and upstream oauth2-proxy
cannot receive back-channel logout because the session is held by a key
only the browser's cookie has.

`all:<app>:<role>` is an application role under the
[naming rule](../design/trust.md#naming): scoped to the tenant the app
serves, and `all` until the app can tell tenants apart. A console that
is really a view onto one cluster binds that cluster's tier instead
(`prod:k8s:viewer`), the way ArgoCD does.

`requires` is the primary gate — nobody outside those groups gets a
token at all, so on the proxied shape the proxy never sees a session. The
proxy's `allow` above is defence in depth and the place to narrow one
route further.

**Never register your sign-out landing page as a redirect too.** Landing
on a redirect URI starts the sign-in the person just ended, and the
render refuses the combination for that reason. If your front page sends
an unauthenticated browser to `/authorize`, then your front page is not a
place to land after signing out — leave `signed_out` off and the issuer
shows its own page, which says what happened.

DNS for the hostname, and the namespace label the fleet egress policy
selects, are the deployment's two remaining edits.

## Traps that were real

- Long work inside a request dies at the gateway's route timeout: trigger
  and poll.
- Test authorization at the handler level, not on the pure function; a
  role check that exists and is never wired passes its unit test.
- The console listener and the service API are two listeners for a
  reason; never mount an operator RPC on the API port.
