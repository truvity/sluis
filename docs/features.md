title: v1 parity checklist
description: Every user-visible capability of sluis v1, with its v1 documentation and its parity issue, and where v2 does it differently.
status: shipped
---

This page lists what sluis v1 does: the checklist for v2 parity. v2 is a rewrite and matches v1 before it adds anything new; parity means that the workloads that use v1 can be wired to v2, possibly in a different way ([Roadmap](/roadmap/)). It is the one page of the site that describes v1 behaviour. The rows were taken from the v1 documentation at release **v1.79.3**; a feature that a later v1 release adds is added when the page is refreshed.

Each row is a GitHub issue labelled [`parity`](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aparity). The roadmap lives in the project's `Product milestone` field ([board](https://github.com/orgs/truvity/projects/9)); the parity rows are in its "v1 parity" milestone, where each issue shows its state. **Changed** says what v2 does instead; **Not in v2** names a part v2 drops. The documentation links go to the [v1 documentation](/v1/).

A **driver** is the technology behind a port (DynamoDB, KMS, rqlite), an **integration** is a connector to an external system, and a **client** or **relying party** consumes sluis tokens.

## Core

The issuer and the policy engine: protocol endpoints, proofs, tokens, sessions and the policy model.

| Feature | What v1 does | v1 documentation |
|---|---|---|
| **[OIDC discovery, key set and caller grants](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/774)** | OpenID discovery, RFC 8414 metadata, the JWKS and /.access/grants, advertising only what is implemented. | [HTTP endpoints](/v1/reference/sluis/endpoints/) |
| **[Authorization endpoint and PKCE](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/775)** | The code flow with S256-only PKCE, query response mode only, `iss` on every redirect and a browser-binding cookie. | [HTTP endpoints](/v1/reference/sluis/endpoints/) |
| **[Token endpoint and ID/access tokens](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/776)** | Single-use codes (a replay revokes what they issued), client authentication, and JWT ID and access tokens. | [HTTP endpoints](/v1/reference/sluis/endpoints/) |
| **[Refresh tokens with rotation and reuse detection](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/777)** | Single-use refresh tokens with a 30-second race grace; a reused token ends the session. | [How do sessions and sign-out work?](/v1/concepts/sluis/sessions/#refresh-token-reuse) |
| **[UserInfo and revocation endpoints](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/778)** | /userinfo (never with a token in the query) and RFC 7009 /revoke for a client's own tokens. | [HTTP endpoints](/v1/reference/sluis/endpoints/) |
| **[RP-initiated logout and sign-out pages](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/779)** | /end_session, /logout and /signed-out, with the post-logout redirect checked against the client. | [HTTP endpoints](/v1/reference/sluis/endpoints/) |
| **[Back-channel logout](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/780)** | A signed logout token to every opted-in client; a delivery error never fails the sign-out. | [How does a relying party learn of a sign-out?](/v1/concepts/sluis/back-channel-logout/) |
| **[Token exchange grant (RFC 8693)](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/782)** | A verified proof exchanged for an access token to a client, gated by its `requires`. | [What does sluis verify and issue?](/v1/concepts/sluis/verify-and-issue/) |
| **[CI identity tokens as a proof](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/783)** | GitHub Actions identity tokens, with an owner allow-list and matchers on repository, ref, workflow and environment. | [What does sluis verify and issue?](/v1/concepts/sluis/verify-and-issue/) |
| **[Workload proofs: Kubernetes ServiceAccount and AWS role tokens](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/784)** | ServiceAccount tokens checked against each cluster's key set (no TokenReview), and AWS outbound-federation tokens. | [What does sluis verify and issue?](/v1/concepts/sluis/verify-and-issue/) |
| **[Exchange controls: sign-in exchange and exchange limits](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/785)** | A sign-in's access token traded for another audience, and limits on the audiences an identity may exchange for. | [What does sluis verify and issue?](/v1/concepts/sluis/verify-and-issue/) |
| **[Policy document: groups, members, matchers, claims, lifetimes](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/786)** | One reviewed policy file mapping directory groups and proofs to internal groups; an invalid file is refused at start. | [The policy](/v1/reference/sluis/policy/) |
| **[Grant naming, declared vocabulary and wildcards](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/787)** | The `<scope>:<thing>:<role>` grammar, a declared vocabulary, and wildcards that never reach sensitive scopes. | [Taxonomy](/v1/reference/sluis/taxonomy/) |
| **[Per-audience token shaping: groups scoping, delimiter, signing algorithm](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/788)** | The `groups` claim narrowed per audience, a group delimiter, and a signing algorithm per client. | [Which groups does a token carry?](/v1/concepts/sluis/groups-in-a-token/) |
| **[Client model: public, confidential, exchange](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/789)** | Public, confidential and exchange clients with `requires`, redirects and `ttl_cap`. | [Policy: clients, resources and self-described clients](/v1/reference/sluis/policy-clients/) |
| **[Generated client secrets and rotation](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/790)** | Generated client secrets, compared in constant time and rotated with an overlap. | [Policy: clients, resources and self-described clients](/v1/reference/sluis/policy-clients/#a-generated-secret) |

| **[Client ID Metadata Documents](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/792)** | Clients identified by an HTTPS URL from allow-listed origins, in place of dynamic registration. | [Policy: clients, resources and self-described clients](/v1/reference/sluis/policy-clients/#clients-that-describe-themselves) |
| **[Sessions: SSO, limits, listing and revocation](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/793)** | An SSO session with per-client sessions, idle and absolute limits, listing and revocation. | [How do sessions and sign-out work?](/v1/concepts/sluis/sessions/) |
| **[Agent-class sessions and consent](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/794)** | Longer chains with 30-minute tokens and a consent page that is never silent. | [How do people and agents differ?](/v1/concepts/sluis/people-and-agents/) |
| **[Recovery sign-in](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/795)** | A way in when no directory can vouch, throttled and audited first. **Changed:** v2 recovery is passkeys only (two attested hardware keys and one pinned synced passkey), with no password and no Kubernetes token check ([Break-glass recovery](/security/break-glass/)). | [What is recovery?](/v1/concepts/sluis/recovery/) |
| **[Web surface hardening and uniform refusals](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/796)** | Security headers, size limits, timeouts, throttles, SSRF-safe fetches and refusals in fixed words. | [HTTP endpoints](/v1/reference/sluis/endpoints/#hardening) |

| Feature | What v1 does | v1 documentation |
|---|---|---|
| **[Console: read model and roles](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/831)** | Every person, group, rule, session and connected system, with each controller's dry run, under operator and viewer roles. | [What does the console do?](/v1/concepts/sluis/console/) |

| **[Audit recording and the Audit page](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/833)** | Every decision recorded as a catalogued action and shown on the console's Audit page. **Changed:** v2 records OCSF events whose action table is code; there is no catalogue document ([ADR 0017](/decisions/0017-audit-records-the-usage-stream-and-quota/#the-action-table-is-code-and-the-release-identifies-it)). | [How does sluis record what happens?](/v1/concepts/sluis/audit/) |
