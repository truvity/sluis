title: Roadmap
description: Where sluis v2 is going. The four product milestones in priority order, what each must do to be done, and the order the installations are built in.
status: shipped
---

The roadmap lives in the `Product milestone` field of the public [sluis v2 board](https://github.com/orgs/truvity/projects/9), and the [project status](/status/) page shows how far each milestone has got. This page says what each milestone is for and when it is done; the reasoning for the order is in [ADR 0018](/decisions/0018-runtimes-installations-and-delivery-order/#delivery-order).

v1 keeps its own roadmap on the [sluis v1 board](https://github.com/orgs/truvity/projects/10), on `master`. New feature requests target v2 ([ADR 0001](/decisions/0001-v1-and-v2-lines/)).

## Where v2 stands

As of 2026-11-01, v2 is in the design phase and has no code. What exists are the [decision records](/decisions/), the [requirements](/requirements/) and the design pages. Root custody lives in [ritueel](https://ritueel.id), a separate project also in design; the first version of sluis needs ritueel's software-root mode ([#1071](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1071)).

## Product milestones

v2 is delivered in four product milestones, in this priority order.

1. **First working version.** The local installation, plus the foundations every installation stands on. The local installation is Docker Compose on a workstation: one container per actor, built from the published images ([#1123](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1123)), with the minimal drivers (embedded SQLite state, a SQLite index, a files blob, a local lock, a spool or direct transport), software keys by default, sign-in through the generic OpenID Connect upstream tested against a real identity provider ([#1106](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1106)), and the audit log with Search ([#1120](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1120), [#1121](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1121), [#1122](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1122); [The local installation](/decisions/0018-runtimes-installations-and-delivery-order/#the-local-installation)).
   - **The core actors** are `entry`, `session`, `console`, `exchange`, `signer`, `policy` and `ca`. They serve the basic OpenID Connect flow (discovery and the key set, authorization with PKCE, tokens, refresh, UserInfo and revocation, form post), passkeys and step-up ([#885](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/885)), and the first stage of the signing API ([#890](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/890)).
   - **Root custody** reaches the installation through the hand-off to ritueel's software-root mode ([#1066](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1066), [#1071](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1071)).
   - **The foundations** are the build and release train, the contracts and the permission manifest, the driver pattern, configuration and key custody.
   - **The milestone also holds** the distribution site ([#873](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/873)), the published images with checksums, SBOMs and keyless provenance ([ADR 0019](/decisions/0019-release-train-packaging-and-distribution/#signing-and-checksums), [#1124](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1124)), workload identity ([#870](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/870)), federation ([#963](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/963)), the verifier drivers ([#965](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/965)) and the conformance pipeline against the local installation ([#1100](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1100)).
   - **Done when** the example install file for local starts under Docker Compose from the published images, and the integration tests run against it in CI.
2. **v1 parity.** Everything v1 does, and the capabilities v2 adds beside it. Parity means that the workloads that use v1 today can be wired to the new sluis, possibly in a different way or with a different configuration, not that behaviour is identical. The milestone has two gates ([ADR 0033](/decisions/0033-evolution-and-compatibility-n-and-n-1-inside-a-major-and-parallel-cutover/#the-v1-parity-milestone-has-two-gates)):
   - **v1-retirement gate.** The replacements of what v1 does. **Done when** every row of the [v1 parity checklist](/features/) is `Done` or `Changed` (with its decision), the lambda and kubernetes installations are built and tested ([installations](/runtimes/installations/)), the inventory of v1's relying parties is complete, and v1's audit and billing history is handled ([ADR 0032](/decisions/0032-data-lifecycle-and-evidence-never-share-a-key-with-personal-data/#v1s-history)). v1 is retired when this gate holds and the fact of [ADR 0001](/decisions/0001-v1-and-v2-lines/) holds.
   - **New-capabilities gate.** What v1 never did: the SSH CA, database certificates, host enrolment, trust sync, the cert-manager issuer, the peer witness and the boards installation. **Done when** each is built and tested; the installation that needs it delivers it, and it does not hold v1 back.
3. **CIAM upstream.** Group single sign-on: the end users of several products of one group sign in once across all of them. sluis stays a broker and hosts no customer accounts: the customer-identity product is one more OpenID Connect upstream ([OIDC upstream](/integrations/oidc-upstream/), [ADR 0046](/decisions/0046-ciam-is-a-broker-the-upstream-owns-accounts-and-sluis-owns-sessions-and-tokens/)).
   - **Done when** the generic OIDC upstream ([#916](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/916)) does claim mapping per upstream, `acr` and `amr` passthrough, step-up (RFC 9470) by re-authentication at the upstream, end-user subjects with their lifecycle ([#1024](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1024)), inbound and outbound back-channel logout and rate limits per connection, and the FAPI 2.0 Security Profile is served to clients that declare it ([#912](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/912), [#929](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/929), [#1025](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1025)). The capacity of the Kubernetes installation is measured before any figure is promised ([ADR 0054](/decisions/0054-capacity-is-measured-before-it-is-promised/), [#878](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/878)).
4. **Quota.** `quota` as a front for installations: applications ask it to admit work before it runs, confirm or cancel the usage after, and push top-ups. It runs beside an installation or on its own ([ADR 0015](/decisions/0015-audit-pieces-transport-search-and-front/), [ADR 0017](/decisions/0017-audit-records-the-usage-stream-and-quota/#quota)).
   - **Done when** quota meters by default and enforces per policy rule for chosen subjects or audiences, a request counts once however often it is retried, and under strict enforcement the admitted total never exceeds the limit under concurrent requests (REQ-QUOTA-001 and REQ-QUOTA-002; work item [#915](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/915)).

## Delivery order

The tested [installations](/runtimes/installations/) are built in this order:

1. **local first,** with the foundations (milestone 1).
2. **Then boards, lambda and kubernetes, built and tested in parallel.** They start when the first working version is done, and none waits for another.
   - **boards.** Three single-board computers behind a Cloudflare tunnel, a YubiKey in each node, state and index on rqlite, and audit logs on R2 with the other nodes as peer witnesses ([Bare metal](/runtimes/bare-metal/)).
   - **lambda.** AWS Lambda.
   - **kubernetes.** The one tested Kubernetes installation ([Kubernetes](/decisions/0018-runtimes-installations-and-delivery-order/#kubernetes)).

EC2 is a possible bare-metal installation, not a delivery target, and not tested. Other installations are possible and untested. The order is reviewed when each installation ships, and ADR 0018 records any change.

## Later

Work planned after the parity milestone is marked Later on the board. It includes CIBA, in poll mode with a passkey on the approving device, once a real consumer exists ([#980](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/980)); ACME for host certificates ([#978](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/978)); device login ([#855](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/855)); a FIPS build variant when a customer needs one ([#868](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/868)); and other clouds and stores. Garage as the boards' blob store is backlog, because it ignores conditional writes ([#982](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/982)).

## Where the work is tracked

The v1 features that v2 must match are issues labelled [`parity`](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aparity), listed on the [v1 parity checklist](/features/). Spike results are in the decision records they settled, such as [ADR 0014](/decisions/0014-the-language-follows-the-executable/#the-spikes-are-gates), and on the issue of each spike.
