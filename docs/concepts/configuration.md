sluis is configured by files that an operator reads and edits, and by the records an operator sets on the console. The design makes four promises about them: a file that is wrong is refused before anything takes effect; a field that does not exist is an error, not silently ignored; any value can be traced to the origin and the layer that set it; and an operational switch can never change who may do what. The rules are [ADR 0010](/decisions/0010-configuration-and-data-pkl-schema-origins-and-sensitivities/).

## Pkl at build time, JSON Schema at run time

The shape of the configuration is defined once, in **Pkl**, and Pkl runs at build time only ([ADR 0010](/decisions/0010-configuration-and-data-pkl-schema-origins-and-sensitivities/#pkl-and-json-schema)). The build generates a **JSON Schema** (draft 2020-12), which is part of the public API, the Helm values schemas and the reference documentation; where Pkl has no generator, a separate open-source tool fills the gap. Generated artifacts are committed, and CI fails on a stale one. **There is no Pkl at run time**: the Pkl tool is about 95 MiB and pkl-go spawns it as a child process, too heavy for a small board or a Lambda function.

- **The schema is embedded in each binary** that loads configuration, and has a stable `$id` with its version in the path. An incompatible change is a new version under a new path, beside the old one.
- **Go and Rust types are hand-written** behind the JSON Schema check; a small generator comes later, when it pays for itself.
- **One validator per language, with shared conformance vectors:** `santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema/v6` in Go, the `jsonschema` crate in Rust, `ajv` in TypeScript. Each vector is a document with the expected verdict and error path, and a validator that disagrees fails the build.
- **Strictness comes from the schema.** `unevaluatedProperties: false` makes an unknown key an error that names the path, and format assertions are on, so a field declared as a URL or a duration is checked as one. Errors never show the value.
- **Retired fields:** a retired option set in a declared file is refused. A retired field in a record that sluis wrote itself is read, ignored and never written again.
- **Telemetry is not configured in the file**: it is the standard `OTEL_*` environment variables only.

The schema also carries each record kind's **origin** and each field's **sensitivity** ([Data and secrets](/concepts/data/#origins-and-sensitivity)); CI checks them, and the backup list, the telemetry allowlist and the audit redaction are generated from them.

## What is configured: an installation

The thing an operator configures is an **installation**: one concrete deployment, made of a **runtime** (bare-metal, serverless or Kubernetes, see [Runtimes](/runtimes/)), the **nodes** (1, N, or elastic on serverless), the available **dependencies** (an AWS account, a Cloudflare account, a YubiKey, a NATS service) and one **driver** per port ([Ports and drivers](/concepts/drivers/)). "Installation" is not a configuration key: the install file *is* the installation ([ADR 0018](/decisions/0018-runtimes-installations-and-delivery-order/#runtime-kinds)). The four tested installations ([local, boards, lambda and kubernetes](/runtimes/installations/)) ship as example install files used by the documentation, the tutorials and the test matrix; an operator copies one as a starting point. The word **environment** is kept for development, staging and production.

**One install file per installation, also in a federation.** A sluis that spans several [boundaries](/concepts/boundaries/) is a front installation plus one boundary installation for each L4 boundary, each with its own install file, joined by declared trust. A boundary below L4 is declared in the install file of the installation that holds it, and every actor instance it gets is named `<actor>@<boundary>` ([Actors](/concepts/actors/)). On bare-metal a systemd generator reads `/etc/sluis/install.yaml` and creates those instances from the template units; on Kubernetes the chart's presets do the same. Nothing generates packages per installation.

## Layers

Declared values come from layers, and a later layer overrides an earlier one ([ADR 0010](/decisions/0010-configuration-and-data-pkl-schema-origins-and-sensitivities/#origins)):

1. **defaults**, built into the schema;
2. **runtime**, the defaults of the runtime kind;
3. **install**, the file the operator edits;
4. **environment overrides**, for the values that differ between development, staging and production, including the few fields marked as tunable that a process environment variable may set.

Layers apply inside declared configuration only; operator-set is an origin, not a layer.

## Declared and operator-set

Two of the five origins are configuration, because they are an operator's intent:

| Origin | What it is | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| **declared** | Reviewed files or infrastructure as code, delivered read-only | Nobody at run time; the operator, through review and deployment |
| **operator-set** | A lasting choice a person makes on the console, the CLI or the API, such as the chat channels an integration manages or a runtime switch, for the record kinds that accept it | The actor that owns the record kind, which validates the write; every change is audited under the person's name |

The **effective configuration** is declared overlaid with operator-set. Learned facts and issued records are data that the configuration refers to, not configuration.

- **Declared locks.** A field that declared sets cannot be changed on the console, which shows it as locked. Otherwise the order is declared, then operator-set, then the schema default.
- **Tighten-only switches** (recovery off, a reconciler paused, a lower quota limit) may be moved by an operator in their safe direction even when declared sets them. Moving one back is a declared change that names a new generation, so a stale document cannot undo a tightening.
- **An object defined in both places is held**: nothing changes on it until one side is removed, or a declared fragment adopts the operator-set record with `adopts: <kind>/<id>@<revision>`.
- **Authority is declared only.** The one exception is Cedar policies linked from declared templates within a declared delegation policy ([ADR 0009](/decisions/0009-policy-is-cedar-in-a-rust-actor/#template-links)).

**Switches never reach authority.** Authority says who may do what: policy, grants, the clients that may ask for tokens. Tunables (a log level, a timeout, the choice of a driver) are declared and may come from an environment override; runtime switches (recovery off, a paused reconciler, an acknowledged breaker) are operator-set, read live and tighten-only where they touch safety.

A secret in configuration is a reference such as `cred:sluis-int-github.app-key`, resolved at run time through the `secrets` port ([Secrets and export](/concepts/data/#secrets-and-export)). The value never appears in a file, in `explain` output, in logs or in a crash dump.

## Live reload

Declared configuration may **live-reload as whole versioned snapshots**, from a file, a ConfigMap, a Lambda layer or AWS AppConfig. A new snapshot is validated as `sluis config check` validates it, swapped atomically and audited with its digest; a snapshot that fails is refused and the version in force stays. A field that a running instance cannot change in place, such as a driver choice, is marked in the schema and applied at the next start. Operator-set values are read live through the `state` port, with a short cache whose lifetime is part of the field's schema.

## Checking and explaining

`sluis config check` validates the configuration against the schema, then validates the installation against the requirements its drivers declare and refuses a combination that cannot work ([How `sluis config check` validates an installation](/concepts/drivers/#how-sluis-config-check-validates-an-installation)). `sluis config explain` prints each field's effective value, its origin and the layer that set it.

Both are **offline by default**, so CI runs them with no call to sluis. With `--live` they also read the operator-set records through the console API, with an operator's credentials: `check --live` lists held objects and the records a new declared fragment would lock or hold, and `explain --live` shows, for an operator-set value, the record id, its revision, who set it and when.

An install file for the boards installation, `/etc/sluis/install.yaml` (field names are [illustrative](/integrations/#examples-are-illustrative)):

```yaml
runtime: bare-metal
nodes: 3
public_url: https://sluis.example.com

dependencies:
  yubikey: { per_node: true }
  cloudflare: { account: example }

drivers:
  yubikey-piv: { instance: shared }

integrations:
  github:
    actor: facts
    app_key: cred:sluis-int-github.app-key   # a reference, never the key
```

What `sluis config explain` prints for it:

```text
runtime                       = bare-metal                     install   /etc/sluis/install.yaml:1
public_url                    = https://sluis.example.com      install   /etc/sluis/install.yaml:3
drivers.yubikey-piv.instance  = shared                         install   /etc/sluis/install.yaml:10
log.level                     = debug                          environment override   SLUIS_LOG_LEVEL (tunable)
integrations.github.app_key   = cred:sluis-int-github.app-key  install   (reference, not resolved)
```
