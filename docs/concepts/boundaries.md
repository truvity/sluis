A **boundary** is the unit of isolation in sluis: what one compromised or misconfigured part cannot cross. The record is [ADR 0005](/decisions/0005-boundaries-and-the-isolation-ladder/); the issuers and tokens are [ADR 0006](/decisions/0006-identity-issuers-audiences-and-sign-in/).

## Kinds of boundary

| Kind | Owns | Holds an authority key |
|---|---|---|
| **Environment** | The machine plane of management, development, staging or production: its keys and intermediates, CA, issuer, sealing key, audit log, trust domain and state | Yes |
| **Company** | The identity plane: the directory, the upstream, the integrations, people's records, operator delegation and the audit tenant's data key | No |
| **Product** | A company and an environment together, with its own keys and issuer, for a company whose customers sign in through sluis | Yes, its own |

Production never shares a key or a state store with development. Product boundaries come with the CIAM upstream milestone ([#1023](https://github.com/truvity/sluis/issues/1023)); none exists before then.

## The isolation ladder

Each boundary declares a level. Each level adds to the one before it.

| Level | Adds |
|---|---|
| **L0 tenant** | Separation by sluis's code only |
| **L1 keys** | Its own sealing key (which also seals grants), CA and signing key |
| **L2 process** | Its own actor instances, uid or role, and state prefix |
| **L3 store** | Its own state store (an rqlite cluster, a DynamoDB table), bucket and queue |
| **L4 runtime** | Its own Kubernetes cluster, cloud account or hosts, and a separate install file joined by declared trust |

A **tenant**, such as an audit or directory tenant, is L0: kept apart by code only, and never a substitute for a boundary. Every environment on a cloud runtime runs at least at L2; companies run at **L2 plus sealed data**, in the front installation. A driver whose backend cannot check its callers is allowed at L3 and above only ([ADR 0004](/decisions/0004-drivers-listeners-and-boundary-enforcement/#three-layers-per-port)). An actor instance carries its boundary in its name, `<actor>@<boundary>` ([Naming](/concepts/actors/#naming)).

## A federation of installations

One sluis, as people see it, is a **federation**: one **front installation** and one **boundary installation for each L4 boundary**, under one operator and joined by declared trust. People get one sign-in address, one console and one identity plane. Boundaries below L4 live in the front installation and are declared in its install file.

    mg["management<br/>environment"]
  end
  subgraph dev["development (L4)"]

    pe["entry@production<br/>and its actors"]
  end
  front -->|"declared trust,<br/>mTLS with SPIFFE IDs"| dev
  front -->|"declared trust,<br/>mTLS with SPIFFE IDs"| prd
```

For example, the front and the management environment share one cloud account, and development, staging and production each run at L4, with their own account or cluster, state and keys.

- **What is shared:** the front, the console, the roots (held by [ritueel](https://ritueel.id)) and the operator.
- **Accepted risks:** a compromise of the roots; the operator who deploys and cluster administrators; a compromise of an environment's `ca`, which reaches every company's workloads in that environment; a bug in a shared policy definition; data held outside sluis. See the [threat model](/security/threat-model/#accepted-risks).
- **A test installation is separate.** It serves no real user, trusts nothing of the federation, and lives outside the sluis host names.

### Across boundaries

A call from one boundary to another is **mutual TLS with SPIFFE IDs** ([Identity](/concepts/identity/#trust-domains)). The target decides again with its own policy; it never takes the caller's decision as its own. A sensitive boundary verifies the **person's passkey assertion itself**, against its own challenge, so a compromised front cannot act there on a person's behalf.

### Promotion: a company leaves

A company leaves, or moves to an installation of its own, by a runbook that exists from the first day:

1. disconnect the company's boundary: its upstream, directory, integrations and minters are its own processes and records;
2. export its slice of the audit trail, then crypto-shred it by deleting its audit tenant's data key ([ADR 0016](/decisions/0016-the-audit-log/)); legal holds are kept outside sluis, so check them first;
3. re-issue its workloads under the new installation's CA;
4. remove the person links of its subjects.

## Issuers and tokens

Each environment has its own issuer, and so does a product boundary. Companies have none: the company is the claim `org` and a policy scope.

| Issuer | Address |
|---|---|
| The group issuer, at the front | `https://sluis.example.com` |
| An environment's issuer | `https://sluis.<env>.example.com`, one origin per host, no path |

- **Discovery and keys are static** documents in a bucket of the boundary, so verification survives a compute outage. The key set lists every active token key with its `x5c` chain.
- **A boundary has no sign-in of its own.** Its slim `entry@<boundary>` takes the group issuer as its upstream; a passkey tap is asked for only where that boundary's policy wants fresh multi-factor authentication.
- **The CLI signs in once.** `sluis login` signs in at the front, and the CLI then exchanges tokens silently at each boundary's own token endpoint. The front never sees a boundary's tokens.
- **One passkey for every issuer.** The boundary hosts are siblings of the group host, so the passkey's relying-party id is the registrable parent (`example.com`), and every verifier checks a strict allow-list of origins: the sluis hosts only.
- **The audit front has a host of its own**, `sluis-audit.<env>.example.com` ([ADR 0015](/decisions/0015-audit-pieces-transport-search-and-front/#the-audit-front)).
- **Step-up is per client and per environment**, in `policy@<boundary>`: a request that needs more answers `insufficient_user_authentication` with `acr_values` ([RFC 9470](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9470)).

### Token claims

| Claim | Rule |
|---|---|
| `iss` | The issuer URL |
| `aud` | **Exactly one registered `client_id`**, never a URL. An RFC 8707 `resource=` selects a registered client and is never copied into `aud`. Between actors of two boundaries, `aud` is the target's SPIFFE ID |
| `sub` | An opaque random id, the same at every issuer, never an e-mail address ([Identity](/concepts/identity/#a-persons-subject)); for a JWT-SVID, the SPIFFE ID |
| `acr`, `amr`, `auth_time`, `cnf.jkt` | How and when the person signed in, and the key the token is bound to |
| grants | Only that boundary's grants |
| `org` | The person's company |

Client ids are unique per issuer, readable, and the same in every environment (`kubernetes`, `argocd`, `aws-<account-alias>`); each AWS account's OIDC provider uses its own, not `sts.amazonaws.com`. Every relying party pins `iss` and `aud`.

## The reference federation

The reference choices for a federation of several companies and environments, beyond those above. The management environment hosts the group-level applications.

| Topic | Choice |
|---|---|
| Subjects | A subject per directory account, plus a declared link between the subjects of one person. Grants are not inherited across the link. An SSH certificate carries the person key |
| Keys | Keys and intermediates per environment, certified through the hand-off to ritueel ([ADR 0013](/decisions/0013-the-hand-off-to-root-custody-and-the-signing-api/#the-hand-off)) |
| State | One engine with a prefix per boundary, replaced by a store of its own at L3 and above |
| Policy | One source, compiled per environment; the environment's sealing key seals its grants. **Company ceilings** are Cedar `forbid` guards: no grant on another company's scope unless declared cross-company |
| Audit | A log per environment, with its own front. Each company reads it as a tenant with its own data key |
| Trust bundles | One per environment, with no signing key of its own ([Identity](/concepts/identity/#the-trust-bundle)). `ca` issues only names and SPIFFE IDs that the requester's proven identity owns |
| SSH | An SSH CA per environment, with per-company principals in its principals bundle ([SSH](/integrations/ssh/)) |
