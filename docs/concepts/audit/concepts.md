# Concepts

## Record

One thing that happened, as seen by one source. Described in
[record.proto](../../../audit/proto/audit/v1/record.proto). The spine is: `id`,
`occurred_at`, `recorded_at`, `source`, `action`, `operation`, `outcome`,
`tenant_id`, `actor`, `targets`, `context`. Around the spine: `subject`,
`capture`, `previous_attributes`, `data`, `meter`, `attributes`, `unmapped`.

Which fields a copy carries is decided by the profile it is written under.
For **core fields**, framework profiles name what must, may and may never be kept, and a
field no framework profile names is dropped. For **extension properties**, the schema
annotates each with a **class** (shared, audit, metering, history or
evidence) and a PII level, and a profile keeps the classes its framework profiles keep.
The record itself does not say which copies carry a core field;
`audit profile explain <name>` prints what a profile keeps.

The record carries **identifiers, never identity attributes**. Names and
e-mail addresses are resolved at read time by whoever may see them.

## Action and operation

`action` is fine-grained and namespaced by source: `wallet.credential.issued`,
`roster.session.revoked` (`roster` is the source name sluis keeps). `operation` is one of seven coarse values:
create, access, modify, remove, authentication, transfer, restore. Both
appear on every record so a reader can filter broadly or precisely.

## Catalogue

Per source, the list of its actions and what each carries: operation,
framework categories, profiles, capture level, delivery mode, target types,
the schema of its `data`, a sentence template per locale, and an optional
meter. Also the source's actor kinds, target types, context areas and
meters. Authored next to the emitting code, validated in that code's CI,
registered at deploy, copied into the archive on first use. Format:
[catalogue.schema.json](../../../audit/sdk/schemas/catalogue.schema.json).

## Extension slots

Fixed places in the record where a source attaches its own data, each keyed
by a discriminator that selects a registered JSON Schema:

| slot | keyed by |
|---|---|
| `data` | action |
| `targets[].attributes` | target type |
| `actor.attributes` | actor kind |
| `context.areas.<area>` | area |
| `meter.dimensions` | meter |

Extension schemas are closed objects with every property annotated with its
class and PII level. See [extension points](../../reference/audit/extension-points.md).

## Actor kinds and identity tiers

An actor kind is registered with a **category**: internal (staff),
external (end users, customers' people), machine (services, API keys, the
system). Framework profiles decide the identity treatment per category: clear,
pseudonym, scoped or omit. Tenant identifiers are legal entities and stay
in clear everywhere. Internal actors stay in clear for the security
retention because accountability is a legal obligation.

What a framework profile asks for is not always what a copy gets. A deployment that
runs no key provider — the default since
[0055](../../decisions/0055-no-pseudonymisation-keys-by-default.md) — declares
that the identifiers it receives for external people are already opaque,
and a framework profile's `pseudonym` is then treated as `clear`: the identifier
written is the one the application minted, which identifies nobody without
the application's own database. A deployment that must be able to
crypto-shred chooses a key provider instead, and then external actors and
subjects become a keyed pseudonym per tenant and purpose, so copies cannot
be joined on a person and erasure is key destruction.
`audit profile explain <name>` prints the effective treatment either way.

## Profiles and framework profiles

A **framework profile** is what one framework requires: fields, categories, identity
treatment, retention, integrity, review, with citations. A **profile** is a
deployment's composition of framework profiles plus a destination. The split writer
produces one copy per profile. See [framework profiles](../../../audit/profiles/README.md).

## Prefixes

Each profile copy lands under `records/<profile>/<tenant>/` and then the
**hour of ingest**, one object per ingest batch, with Object Lock retention set
per object. A record's own date does not decide where it lives; a reader finds
it by the hour it was ingested. The profile comes first because a lifecycle rule
filters by literal prefix and takes no wildcards, so a rule per profile is only
expressible that way; a role scoped to one customer still works, because the
tenant is the next component and a policy's resource may carry a wildcard. The
layout is specified in the [bucket contract](../../reference/audit/bucket-contract.md).

What describes the records is copied on first use: the catalogue as registered
under `catalogue/<app>/<version>`, written once, and its extension schemas, the
record's own schema and its proto under a schema prefix. A locked object
outlives this repository, and a record whose schema has been deleted is a record
nobody can read.

## Projections

Everything that is not a prefix copy: the facet index and counts table, the
metering rollups and statements, SIEM exports, analytics tables. All
idempotent, all rebuildable from the prefixes.

## Meta-events

Reads and exports of the trail, catalogue and profile changes, key
destruction, legal holds, verifications, writer lifecycle and the daily clock
check are records too, in the [common catalogue](../../../audit/sdk/catalogue/common.yaml).
