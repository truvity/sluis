# Metering

One write path, two projections, two locked prefixes — both under the
installation's own prefix in the environment's bucket.

This projection reads only what the write path already produces: the billing
profile's copies and the outcome rule on metered actions. It is what validates
the design's central claim, that two projections of one record cannot be joined
on a person. They cannot because the metering profile keeps nobody: no actor,
no subject, only a quantity per tenant and meter. Where a deployment does run
pseudonymisation keys, the two copies also carry different pseudonyms for one
person, but that is a second line and not the one the claim rests on
([0055](../../decisions/0055-no-pseudonymisation-keys-by-default.md)).

It runs in either deployment shape. The rollups are filled at index time by
whichever process writes, and only the
[usage quotas](../../guides/audit/operate/enable-usage-quotas.md) extension — a second
consumer of the same records — needs [stream mode](stream-mode.md).

## Fields

Billable actions carry `meter` with `name`, `quantity` (decimal string),
`unit`, `kind` (count or gauge) and flat `dimensions`. The billing profile
keeps `id`, `occurred_at`, `recorded_at`, `source`, `action`, `tenant_id`,
`meter` and `origin_hash`, and nothing about people.

## Which records count

The billing copy carries the outcome, because the first thing a customer
disputing an invoice asks is whether the call succeeded. The catalogue says
which outcomes a metered action counts, and the default is success only: a
refused call is not a billable one. An action that bills attempts, say a
verification that is charged whether or not it passes, lists the outcomes it
counts. The rollup reads that from the catalogue and never guesses.

## Counts and gauges

Counts are events. Stored bytes and similar levels are **absolute samples**
emitted on a schedule (hourly) and billed as the average over the period,
the way object storage and CI providers meter storage. Never deltas.

## Projection

- `usage_dedup(id, source, seen_at)` with the framework profile's dedupe window.
- `usage_hourly(tenant_id, meter, hour, quantity, event_count, last_event_id)`
  upserted idempotently.
- `usage_statement(tenant_id, meter, period, quantity, event_id_range,
  seal_key, computed_at)` written once at period close and never
  updated. The statement plus the locked billing copies are the seven-year
  administration.

## Period close

The period closes `close_after_hours` after its end (default 72). Later
events are flagged, not billed; corrections are credit notes, never
rewrites. Reprocessing replays the period's billing copies into a fresh
rollup and diffs against the statement; the diff is kept as the
reconciliation.

## Rating

The rating engine (a payment provider's meters, or an in-house one) receives
rollups, not raw events, in pre-aggregated mode with an idempotency key per
tenant, meter and hour. It is never the evidence store.
