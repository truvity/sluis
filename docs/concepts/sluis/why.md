# Why sluis exists

The [README](../../../README.md) says what it is and where it sits among the
alternatives. This page is the longer argument: the situation it starts
from, the problems it solves, and the principles that decide every
design question after that.

## The situation it starts from

An installation already has, or can have for free:

- **corporate directories** — Google Workspace for each company, Entra
  next — where every employee already exists, with a password, MFA and
  device policy;
- **a CI platform** — GitHub Actions — that gives every job a signed,
  short-lived identity token;
- **clusters** whose API servers give every ServiceAccount the same
  kind of token, and publish the key set that verifies it;
- **infrastructure that speaks OIDC** — Kubernetes, AWS, ArgoCD, Kargo,
  any console behind a gateway.

What it does not have is the connective tissue: something that turns
"Alice is in group platform-admins in the globex.example Workspace" into
"Alice may assume role power in account 1111, is cluster-admin on prod,
and is an operator in the directory console", and turns "this is job
4711 of acme/platform on master" into "this job may deploy to
dev" — with one place to read the policy and no stored secret
anywhere.

## The problems, concretely

1. **Groups are not in anyone's token.** Google's ID token carries no
   groups. Entra's does, with an overage limit, and only for Entra.
   Every relying party that authorizes by group needs someone to read
   the directory.
2. **Leavers must lose access without a click.** A suspended account
   keeps any session it already has unless something notices. That
   something must know whether its answer can be trusted, or it will
   remove access on a hiccup. The same holds where membership lives outside a
   token: GitHub teams and Slack channels are kept in step with the groups, and
   a leaver is removed only on an answer the directory vouches for.
3. **Several directories, one policy.** Two companies, two Workspaces,
   later a third tenant; the mapping to infrastructure roles must live
   in one file, not in each Workspace's admin console and each cluster's
   RBAC.
4. **AWS without Identity Center.** A trust policy for a custom issuer
   can see only `sub`, `aud`, `amr` and `email`. Group-based cloud roles
   need an issuer that gates *audiences* by policy. No corporate IdP
   does that.
5. **One issuer per cluster.** An EKS cluster trusts one external OIDC
   issuer. People and CI jobs must both arrive through it, so a GitHub
   token has to be exchanged somewhere.
6. **Machines with no secrets.** CI and workloads must obtain cloud and
   cluster credentials from the token their platform already gave them,
   under a policy that is the same file as the human one.
7. **Consoles without login code.** Every internal UI needs login,
   session, sign-out and a bearer to read. None of them should implement
   any of it.

## Why not just…

| Tool | What it gives | Where it stops |
|---|---|---|
| **Google Workspace as the issuer** | one issuer for both Workspaces, sign-in, MFA | no groups in the token; no audience gating for AWS; cannot exchange a CI token; no second directory behind the same issuer |
| **dex** | a stateless federating issuer, Kubernetes-friendly, a ConfigMap | no hook to look up groups, so Google users have none; fixed claims; no policy; no audience gating; token exchange without rules. The right shape, one step short |
| **Zitadel, Keycloak, Authentik** | federation, a login hook, machine users | a database, an operator and a login UI to run; a directory reader per tenant, a login hook to compute roles, a broker for CI tokens to write. The eighty percent of an IdP that costs and the twenty percent that is used |
| **Okta, Auth0, Entra ID** | everything, rented | policy lives in their UI and their API, not in git; machine identities are secrets to rotate; the infrastructure's identity depends on a vendor's uptime and pricing |
| **AWS IAM Identity Center** | AWS roles by group, SCIM from the directory | answers only AWS, not clusters, consoles or CI |
| **GitHub → AWS direct federation** | zero code for CI to AWS | policy sprawls into every account's trust policies keyed on subject patterns; nothing for clusters, because a cluster trusts one issuer |
| **Teleport, Boundary, an access mesh** | a full access plane with agents | its own agent model and identity store; SSO connectors are enterprise features; it replaces the gateway rather than sitting behind it |

None of these is wrong. Each solves two or three of the seven problems.
sluis is the smallest set of parts that solves all seven with
the things the installation already has.

## Principles

These decide every design question, and when two of them conflict the
earlier one wins.

1. **Verify, never authenticate.** A password, a user record, MFA or a
   consent screen is an identity provider's job, not a feature here.
   There are no users in this system, only sessions.
2. **Configuration is chart values.** No database, no operator, no
   admin UI that writes policy. The policy is a file in git; the console
   reads it and never edits it, so `git log` is the complete history of
   access to infrastructure. What the console does write — a directory it
   connected, a GitHub App an owner created, a Slack workspace an owner
   connected, a confirmation, and the records of Slack channels that people
   rather than infrastructure own — is bootstrap, removal and a few records of
   its own, each audited, kept in a handful of ConfigMaps and Secrets a copy of
   restores. Those records never name an internal group and never grant access
   to infrastructure.
3. **Almost nothing is a secret.** One signing key. The OAuth client
   credentials the corporate IdP issued. The refresh token a directory
   admin's consent produced, the key of a GitHub App an owner
   created from the console, and the bot token of a Slack App an owner
   installed. Nothing else — machines prove themselves
   with tokens their own platform issued, and the issuer holds no
   credential to verify them, only a public key set. The one more throwaway is
   a Slack app configuration token, used once and never stored.
4. **Strict where implemented, and not one grant more.** Three grants
   and three endpoints — six things — cover a browser, a CLI with a
   browser to confirm in, and a machine that already holds a token. Each one that is served passes the
   conformance suite; each one that is not needed is not served, because
   every served endpoint is surface to keep truthful.
5. **One issuer, one policy, one vocabulary.** However many clusters,
   accounts and corporate directories, there is one `iss`, one file, and
   one flat `groups` claim that nothing downstream re-maps.
6. **Authoritative or hold.** A failed probe, a stale snapshot, a domain
   claimed twice: all read as "not authoritative", and nothing removes
   access on that answer.
7. **The lightest footprint for the relying party too.** ArgoCD, Kargo
   and a cluster each get a client id and an issuer URL and nothing else
   to configure. A console with no OpenID of its own gets a chart.

## What a token is for, now that it can be two things

Through v1.28 a token was minted for the client asking, because the
client and the thing a person reached were the same object. That stopped
holding once a client — an editor, a hosted assistant, anything speaking
the Model Context Protocol — is not itself what a token is *for*: a
**resource** may be declared instead, named by the client with the
`resource` parameter (RFC 8707), and it becomes the token's audience,
gated by its own `requires` alongside the client's. And a client this
installation does not deploy and cannot enumerate may identify itself
with a URL that serves a document about itself (a Client ID Metadata
Document) instead of a row in the policy, admitted only from an
allow-listed origin. Both are declared, gated the same way as everything
else, and off unless an installation writes them — see
[reference/policy.md](../../reference/sluis/policy.md#resources--what-a-token-is-for).

## What it is not

Not a customer-facing identity provider: a product whose customers sign
in with their own IdP needs per-organisation federation, and only the
directory connector here is reusable for that. Not a service mesh:
workloads keep their platform identities. Not a secrets manager. Not a
replacement for the corporate directory: it reads one, and if the
directory is wrong, so is every token. Not a chat or source-hosting
administrator: it keeps the membership of GitHub teams and Slack channels equal
to groups it already resolves and does nothing else there — it creates no
accounts, manages no user groups and removes no one from a public Slack
channel.
