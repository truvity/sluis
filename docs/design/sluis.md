# sluis — the design

**Status:** shipped. One process reads the corporate directories, applies
the policy, issues tokens, serves the login page and serves the console.

This is the design of that process. The rule it stands on — two trust
anchors, one vocabulary — is [trust.md](trust.md); every container and
how they connect is [architecture.md](../architecture.md); the contracts
are under [reference/](../reference/). It replaces two earlier documents,
one per service, and the appendix at the end says what was removed on the
way and why.

## Purpose

One installation-wide issuer that every cluster, cloud account, CD system
and console trusts, fed by the corporate directories the company already
runs.

It answers two questions about a person — **is this account live** and
**who is in this group** — and turns the answer into a token, under a
policy that is a file in git. It holds every directory credential so that
nothing downstream holds any. It authenticates nobody: sign-in, passwords,
MFA and device policy stay with Google Workspace or Entra.

## One process, and why

The directory reader and the token service were two deployments until
0.12. The split was built so that several things could ask the directory
of record — a controller, a hook, another cluster. The issuer became its
only consumer, and from then on the split was paid for on **every single
login**: a ConnectRPC call, a TokenReview, a NetworkPolicy hop, a second
store, and a class of failure where the two halves disagreed about the
same person.

So the answer about a person is a function call. What that leaves is one
chart, one Valkey, one policy file, one health endpoint, and a console
served on the issuer's own origin — plus, beside the service, the one
processes that had to be separate, the GitHub controller and the Slack
controller, because each holds keys and writes somewhere else.

The directory's own endpoint stays unserved. The candidates for it,
the GitHub and Slack controllers, read the console's API instead, with its own
ServiceAccount token verified against the cluster's published key set
like any workload's.

## The directory model

```
Workspace {
  id           string      # the backend's tenant id (Google: customer id)
  backend      google | entra
  domains      []string    # DISCOVERED from the backend, re-read on every probe
  serve        []string    # OPTIONAL: which of those to answer for; empty = all
  admin        string      # the account the credential acts as
  credential   oauth-refresh-token | service-account-key
  connectedBy  string      # console identity that connected it
  connectedAt  time
  health       { probedAt, ok, error }
}
```

The console calls a workspace a **directory**, and the groups it holds
**directory groups** (it said *provider* before). The rail puts each
under its own heading, *Identity* and *Access*, so the two sides read as
mirrors; the model, the URLs and the API keep the older word.

- **Domains are discovered, not typed.** After connecting, the tenant's
  domain list is read and re-read on every probe. A domain that moves
  between tenants follows automatically: the backend never lets one domain
  belong to two tenants at once, so the move is sequential. Should two
  connected workspaces ever claim one domain, neither is authoritative for
  it until the conflict clears, and the console says so.
- **Routing is by email domain.** Every request naming an address is
  answered by the workspace serving that domain. An address in no served
  domain gets `in_domain=false` — no opinion, never "gone".
- **Serving is narrower than owning.** A workspace answers for every domain
  its tenant owns unless it is narrowed to a subset. What is left out is
  still discovered and still shown, so an operator can tell "not our
  business" from "missing"; it routes nothing and its accounts are not
  kept.

  Three things fall out of it. A tenant that happens to own a domain
  another tenant serves is no longer a conflict, so two overlapping
  directories can coexist. The choice cannot grant anything, because the
  only domains that may be named are the ones discovery returned — the
  ceiling is the directory's own verified list, and every setting is a
  subtraction from it. And because the served list is intersected with
  discovery rather than trusted over it, a domain moving between tenants
  hands over on its own.
- **Authoritative is per domain.** A domain is authoritative when its
  workspace's last probe succeeded within the freshness window and no
  other workspace serves it too. Consumers that remove access act only on
  authoritative answers; this flag is the safety-critical part of the
  contract.

## Freshness

The directory is not read on the request path. One **snapshot per
workspace** is kept — domains, every group with its flat members, every
account with its live flag, and `snapshot_at` — and a background refresher
replaces it every `refresh_interval` (default 15 minutes) under a shared
lease, so one replica fetches for all.

Every read takes an optional `max_age`: omitted serves the current
snapshot, a value makes it fresher first when it is older, zero fetches
now, and a failed fetch serves the stale snapshot with
`authoritative=false`. Freshness is honoured by the cheapest path that
satisfies it. Bulk reads trigger a full workspace read, single-flight.
Point reads fetch one account and its groups live and patch the snapshot,
so a login is never held behind a full read. A miss on an in-domain
address always goes live once before answering `found = false`, because
not-found is a removal signal: an account created after the last snapshot
is never reported absent.

A served domain that is not authoritative is **provisional**, and the
console says why: *first snapshot pending*, *snapshot stale*, or *probe
failed*; a domain two workspaces both serve is *contested*. The wire
contract is the `authoritative` boolean and nothing else; the word is the
console's.

### Nothing slow on the request path

After the first live connect, three things had crept onto the request
path and all three met a gateway's fifteen-second timeout. Each was
cancelled mid-read, each restarted from zero on the next request, and a
consent callback reported failure on a connect that had succeeded.

The rule: **a request never waits on the directory.** Adopting a
workspace stores it and returns; the first snapshot runs detached, under
the process's own context, single-flight. A read with no snapshot answers
*first snapshot pending* — provisional and empty — and lets the refresher
fill it. Narrowing stores the new list, drops what is now excluded at
once, and refreshes detached. The only request-scoped read left is the
point lookup, which is one account and bounded. Raising the gateway's
timeout is not the fix: a longer timeout would only hide the next thing
that approached it.

### Every replica knows every workspace

Also 2026-09-09. Readers were opened from stored credentials once, at
start, so a workspace adopted on one replica did not exist on the other
until it restarted. The store is the truth and the reader map is a cache
of it: a replica with no reader for a workspace the store knows opens one
from the stored credential on first use.

### The cache

Snapshots, sessions and the logins in progress live in **Valkey**,
external to the process: the chart takes an address and credentials. With
a shared store, replicas answer from the same snapshot, a restart is warm,
and the directory is read once per interval regardless of replica count.
Valkey holds no credential — losing it costs one fetch per workspace and
one sign-in per person.

Two things about it were learned the hard way on 2026-09-10, when a
Valkey pod moved and every client went on dialling the old address for
half an hour while reporting healthy.

- **Cluster mode is off unless there are several shards.** With one shard
  it makes the client learn node addresses from `CLUSTER SLOTS` and talk
  to those, bypassing the Kubernetes Service — the one mechanism whose
  whole job is to survive a pod moving.
- **Readiness follows the store; liveness deliberately does not.** A
  replica that cannot reach it leaves the gateway's rotation and answers
  fast instead of hanging, and nothing is restarted, so one blip cannot
  restart the fleet. The refusal names the dependency and the reason.

The refresh lease is **held for the interval, not for the work**.
Replicas do not tick together: a lease let go when a refresh finished
would be taken by the replica whose turn came four minutes later, which
would read the same directory again — and a directory's API quota is per
tenant, not per reader. A successful pass leaves its lease to expire; only
a failed pass hands one straight back, because then somebody else should
try. None of it applies to a refresh somebody asked for.

## The policy

One file: [reference/policy.md](../reference/policy.md). Every proof
resolves to internal groups — people through their provider groups,
machines through matchers — and the groups are the whole of what a token
carries and the whole of what a client's `requires` gates on.

**One layer.** Who is in which internal group is this file, rendered from
the installation's own access model and reviewed in git, and nothing
else. A console that could add a membership was a second source of truth
beside git and a merge to reconcile them, so `git log` is the complete
history of access.

**Validated at load.** A policy the process will not accept is a start-up
failure, which in a rolling update means the new pod crash-loops while the
previous pods go on serving the previous policy — the ConfigMap is
correct, every Application reads Synced, and the only symptom is that the
new clients are absent. That failure is invisible by construction, so the
render validates its own output with this same loader at CI time.

## What it verifies

| Proof | From | How |
|---|---|---|
| a corporate sign-in | Google Workspace, Entra next | an OIDC authorization-code flow this process starts and finishes; the address it returns is resolved against the directory in the same process |
| a CI identity token | GitHub Actions, per organisation | token exchange, verified against GitHub's key set. The **owner** allow-list is the whole trust boundary — anybody gets a valid token for their own repository, so an empty list verifies nothing — and the audience must be this issuer's own URL, so a token minted for a cloud provider cannot be replayed here |
| a workload token | a ServiceAccount in **any** cluster | token exchange, verified against the key set that cluster publishes for its own ServiceAccount tokens. One row per cluster: a name and a URL, no credential |

The third row is what makes one issuer serve many clusters cheaply. The
other way to check such a token is a TokenReview, which means holding a
kubeconfig for every cluster whose workloads may exchange, inside the
service designed to hold almost no credential. A key set is public: EKS
publishes one per cluster — it is what IRSA rests on — and Talos serves
the same keys at the API server's `/openid/v1/jwks`. This process's own
cluster is a row like any other, because a special case for it would be a
second code path only one installation exercises.

What is given up, plainly: a TokenReview notices a deleted ServiceAccount
and a key set does not, so a token stays usable until it expires. Bound
tokens are short-lived, so the window is minutes.

A failure to reach the directory is an error and never an empty answer.
The hold window rests on that distinction: an identity keeps its
last-known groups for a bounded time only while "I could not ask" can be
told from "the directory says nothing".

## What it issues

Six grants, and nothing else. Each exists for one of three needs: a
browser reaching a web UI, a CLI on a laptop with a browser to confirm in,
and a machine that already holds a token.

| Grant | For |
|---|---|
| authorization code + PKCE | every browser flow, and every CLI: `sluisctl login` and kubelogin open a browser and listen on a loopback port |
| refresh | sessions that outlive a token |
| userinfo | relying parties that ask |
| `end_session` | sign-out ends the sign-in, not one application's cookie |
| revocation | "sign out everywhere", and the operator's revoke |
| **token exchange** | the one machine grant, and the CLI's re-audiencing for a cluster, AWS or any other audience |

Three of the six are grants and three are endpoints, so
`grant_types_supported` prints three and the rest are advertised in their
own fields. Listing an endpoint as a grant type would be the metadata
lying in a new way.

Token exchange takes three kinds of subject, all verified the same way,
against a key set this process trusts and holds no credential for:

| Subject | Verified against | Rule kind |
|---|---|---|
| a GitHub Actions token | GitHub's key set, an owner allow-list | CI job: repository, ref, visibility |
| a ServiceAccount token from any cluster | that cluster's key set | workload: cluster, namespace, name |
| the access token of a CLI sign-in, presented by that client | our own key set, and the client's `sign_in_exchange` | none: re-audiencing for a cluster, AWS or another audience |

The third row is narrower than it was. Through 1.5.4 the exchange took
any token this process had signed whose claims named a person, and an
ID token does: it is handed to every relying party a person signs in to,
so a holder of one could have exchanged it for any audience the person's
groups admit. Now the only token of its own the issuer takes is the
access token of a live session at a **public** client that declares
`sign_in_exchange: true`, presented by that client — the CLI — and
everything else it signs is refused.

The third row is why it is *one* grant. AWS accepts only a token whose
`aud` matches a client on its OIDC provider, so `sluisctl` trades the
token it holds for one audienced at AWS.

The protocol is a library — `github.com/zitadel/oidc/v3` — certified for
the Basic and Config profiles. What this process contributes is not
protocol: the storage behind the library in Valkey, the mapping from the
policy to the claims in a token, the verifiers, the session index, and two
small HTML pages. The conformance suite proves the library is wired
correctly, not that we wrote a protocol.

## Sessions and sign-out

Three things get called a session and each has one owner. A proxy holds
the **browser session** for one console, a ticket cookie with the state in
Valkey. This process holds the **SSO session** with the browser, so a
second console needs no second login, and one **refresh token per identity
and client**, which is what kubelogin, `sluisctl` and every proxy
actually hold.

**The SSO session is the keystone.** A cookie at the issuer's host,
HttpOnly, backed by a record in the shared store: identity, `auth_time`,
how they authenticated. `/authorize` completes **silently** when it is
live, so signing in at one console and opening a second is a redirect with
no prompt; it honours `prompt=login` and `max_age`. `end_session` clears
it. Each per-client session points at the SSO session that parents it, so
*sign out everywhere* is one operation on the parent.

Per-client sessions are first-class too, not opaque tokens in a store: a
per-identity index of client, how it was obtained, issued, expires, last
refreshed, so they can be **listed** per identity and per client and
**revoked** per identity, per client, or one at a time. The index lives in
the **shared** store, because an index per process listed what one replica
happened to record and revoked only there — for a control whose whole job
is to end access, the worst failure available. A refresh token is hashed
into its key, so an index that can be read is not an index that can be
replayed.

Sign-out ends the sign-in AND every session opened under it, and it does
both through whichever door was used: `/logout`, which a person follows,
and `end_session`, which a proxy chains to. Ending the sign-in alone
stops the next silent `/authorize` and nothing else.

The design used to say only that much, and leaned on the other sessions
dying *"at their next refresh"*. They do not, because nothing was
revoking the refresh tokens — so a console the person had already opened
kept refreshing successfully and serving pages for as long as its own
cookie lasted, after a sign-out that reported success. Reported from a
proxied console; fixed in v0.14.2 for `/logout` and v0.14.4 for `end_session`,
which is the door that actually mattered because it is the one a proxy
uses.

What a sign-out reaches is scoped by what the request can PROVE, which is
the cookie it carries. An `id_token_hint` is a hint in the specification
rather than a credential — the library accepts an expired one by design —
so it chooses the signed-out page and nothing else. A request that proves
nothing ends nothing: before v0.14.4 it ended every session in the
installation, which is [the security note](../../CHANGELOG.md).

### The absolute session limit

Everything above bounds *inactivity* — a session dies once nothing
refreshes it for `config.lifetimes.refresh`. Nothing bounded the sign-in
ITSELF: a client that refreshed often enough stayed signed in
indefinitely, because a rotation only ever asked "was this used
recently", never "how long ago did this person actually authenticate".
`config.lifetimes.absolute` (default 24h) is that second question, and a
per-client session's end has been `min(now+refresh, auth_time+absolute)`
since v1.30.0 — decided when it opens and recomputed on every rotation,
so a sliding refresher plateaus at the limit rather than climbing past
it. `auth_time` is carried down from the SSO session (or the sign-in
itself, for one opened directly), never from the refresh — a session
opened against an hour-old SSO session inherits that hour, not a fresh
24.

Three things enforce it, because a session end recorded in an index is
worth nothing if the things that use it do not check:

- **A refresh at or after the limit** is refused (`invalid_grant`) and
  the session is revoked, with its own audit reason — distinct from an
  ordinary inactivity timeout or a lost entitlement, both of which the
  session index also produces, but silently.
- **An access or ID token's `exp`** is capped at `auth_time+absolute`
  too, even when the ordinary token lifetime would reach further: a
  session that has just hit the limit must not go on answering
  `userinfo`, or any resource trusting the token's own `exp`, for
  whatever was left of its last token.
- **Silent `/authorize`** refuses an SSO session whose `auth_time` is
  past the limit, ending it first — the same cascade `/logout` runs,
  Back-Channel Logout included — rather than completing against it. A
  browser left open must not go on renewing its sign-in one client at a
  time forever, which is exactly what a live SSO session with no other
  check would let it do.

A read-only resource may carry a longer limit of its own, up to seven days
([ADR 0033](../decisions/0033-a-longer-absolute-limit-for-read-only-resources.md)).
Each of the three checks above then uses the limit of the resource the session
was opened for: the shortest `absolute_cap` among a chain's resources, the
global limit for the client's own audience or any resource without a cap. A
silent `/authorize` past the global limit ends the browser sign-in for a
request that is not extended, but spares the extended chains the browser
still holds, which end by sign-out, revocation or their own limit.

A session with no `auth_time` has nothing to measure the limit against,
and none applies: it lives out its ordinary refresh window, exactly as
before. That is true of a workload or a machine trading a proof through
token exchange, which authenticates nobody — and, until its next fresh
sign-in, of a per-client session recorded before this field existed,
which reads as the same zero value. Both are unaffected on purpose, not
by omission: there is nothing to cap either against, the same reasoning
either way.

The console's own session (`config.lifetimes.session`, a fixed-duration
cookie rather than a sliding one) is capped too — by the shorter of the
two — because it is issued once at sign-in and its issue time already IS
its `auth_time`.

### Who may open which console

A client's `requires` names the internal groups any one of which admits
somebody to it. It is checked in three places, and for a long time only
one of them: **token exchange**, where the audience is the decision;
**a browser sign-in**, as the request is completed; and **a refresh**,
as the session is renewed.

The middle one was missing until 1.1.0, which made `requires` on a
browser client documentation rather than a gate — anybody this issuer
would authenticate received a token for any declared client. What
stopped them was whatever the application checked for itself, which for
a console with no authorization of its own and a proxy posture of
`authenticated` was nothing.

The check cannot happen at `/authorize`: the request arrives before
anyone has proved who they are, so there is nobody to judge. It happens
when the sign-in completes, which is the first moment both facts exist.

A refusal there is a **page**. The relying party is not the one that
needs telling, and a redirect carrying an error produces a console
rendering its own version of a refusal it does not understand. The
person is signed *in* — the browser session stands, and the next console
they are entitled to costs them no password.

The third check is why the second is not enough on its own. A grant
removed after a token was issued would otherwise keep working for as
long as the refresh token lives; re-checking at renewal ends it at the
next refresh instead, which for a proxied console is its `ttl_cap`.

### Telling the relying party: Back-Channel Logout

Everything above is immediate at the issuer and invisible at the relying
party. A console holding a valid access token keeps serving until it
next refreshes, and until then a person who has signed out is still
being served pages. `ttl_cap` BOUNDS that window, per client. Since
0.16.0 a client may also ask to be told, and then the window closes.

A client that declares `backchannel_logout_uri` is POSTed a signed
logout token, server to server, the moment a sign-out ends a session it
holds. One that declares none is never contacted, which is what makes
serving this safe: it changes nothing for a client that has not asked.

**Why this one, of the three optional mechanisms.** Session Management
and Front-Channel Logout both work by loading something from the
issuer's origin inside the application's page — a polled iframe, or one
hidden iframe per client at sign-out. Browsers block third-party cookies
by default now, so both fail quietly in exactly the case they exist for.
This is an HTTP POST between two servers and does not care what a
browser allows.

It is also the only one of the three that could ever reach a PROXY,
which is what actually holds the session for a console running no OpenID
flow of its own. *Could*, not *does*: oauth2-proxy encrypts each session
with a secret that lives only in the user's cookie, so nothing
server-side can find the session a logout token names. Until that
changes upstream, the refresh interval is the whole of the dial for a
proxied console, and the chart sets it to a minute.

Two details the specification is strict about, and both are pinned by
tests: `typ` is `logout+jwt`, and there is no `nonce`. Both exist so
that a logout token cannot be mistaken for an ID token by a relying
party that checks too little — which would turn *you are signed out*
into *you are signed in as somebody*.

**Who is told, and by which name.** A session in the index is a refresh
token, and a client that asked for `openid` alone holds none — yet it
signed somebody in and has to be told when that ends. So the sign-in
remembers which clients were issued an ID token under it, and at
sign-out every one of them is told, with or without a refresh token. The
token's `sid` is the one the relying party's ID token carried, which is
the per-client session and not the browser sign-in it hangs
off: a relying party matches the two by that value, and the first
version named the sign-in instead — a token that verified and matched
nothing. A client whose ID token carried no `sid` is told by `sub`
alone, which the specification allows. Both were found by the
Foundation's Back-Channel plan on the first day it could receive a
token at all.

The order is deliberate in both directions. The sessions are read
BEFORE the revocation, because afterwards nothing records which clients
held them. The tokens go out AFTER it, because a client told its session
ended and then finding it alive is worse than one told a moment late.
Delivery failures are logged and never raised: the sign-out has already
happened, and a relying party that cannot be reached must not turn a
completed sign-out into a failed one.

A revoked or suspended person is stopped separately, by the next refresh
being refused, with the directory's liveness signal behind it. To end
somebody *else's* session is **revocation**, through `RevokeSessions`,
which authorizes the caller first.

**And the console got exactly that wrong** (found in production, 0.12.8).
Every Revoke button on the Sessions page sent a *session id*, and the
by-id path ends one session and nothing else. Revoking every row of a
browser therefore left its SSO session standing: the list emptied, the
person believed they had signed out everywhere, and the next `/authorize`
completed silently with no password. The half sign-out that looks exactly
like a whole one — the failure this design names twice and the console
still shipped.

The page now offers **signing the browser out** beside the rows, which
ends the SSO session and every session under it. The rows keep their
narrow meaning, because ending one session that is not the one you are
using is a real thing to want, and the two acts should not be one button.

What none of this reaches by itself is a relying party's **own**
session. A console that ran its own flow holds its own cookie, and
`end_session` is front-channel. A client that opts in with
`backchannel_logout_uri` is told at the moment of sign-out, as the
section above says; one that does not — Kargo, which has no such
endpoint, or any console behind `access-proxy`, whose session no server
can open — answers until its own session expires or refreshes. That is
the honest boundary of revocation at an issuer, and the reason a relying
party's session lifetime, and `ttl_cap`, are decisions rather than
details.

### One origin

The issuer sits at the **root** of the domain and the console takes a path
beside it. That is protocol, not taste: the issuer URL is the `iss` claim
in every token, and discovery lives at
`/.well-known/openid-configuration` at an origin root. An issuer with a
path component relocates its discovery URL to a place Kubernetes and AWS
handle badly.

What the shape buys is that the console is **same-origin**: its session
pages call the issuer with the browser's own cookie, and the question of
how a console reaches sessions in another origin stops existing.

Since the merge the prefix is stripped in-process rather than by the
gateway, which surfaced the one thing that is easy to miss: the console's
handlers never see the prefix, but every link they hand a **browser** has
to carry it, because `/login` resolves against the origin — where the
issuer's page is, not the console's. The mount is read from the address
the console is published at rather than configured a second time.

The **admin-consent callback stays at the origin root**. It is the one
flow that runs before anybody can be signed in, and its redirect URI is
registered with every corporate tenant, so moving it under the console's
path would mean re-registering it in each of them.

Renaming an issuer invalidates every token in circulation, which is why
the decision was made while exactly one client trusted it.

## The console

**It signs people in as a client of this issuer.** Somebody with no
session is sent to `/authorize` with the console's own declared client,
signs in once at the issuer's login page, and comes back with the
issuer's session cookie set — which the console then reads, the way it
reads anybody's. One door, and the console holds nothing special.

Two things fall out of that, and both are the point. There is no proxy
in front of the console running an OpenID flow against a service in the
same process, and there is no login of the console's own — the second
door an installation with a gateway turns off.

The code the flow hands back is **never redeemed**. What the console
needed was the session the flow established, not a token: it reads the
directory and the policy in this same process. Redeeming would mean
holding something it has no use for and either a client secret to keep
or a verifier to carry across the redirect. The code expires unused and
is stripped from the URL, so it reaches no bookmark and no referrer.

The console **reads**. It shows every person, every provider group, every
internal group, every rule that grants one, every open session, and every
GitHub organisation and Slack workspace with what its controller would change —
the whole chain from a directory to a client, and why each link exists.

A person's page states that chain as one line per internal group held,
not just the group's own name: the directory group or matcher at the
root, a [mapping wildcard](../taxonomy.md#mapping-wildcards) named when one
is the reason (`*:k8s:admin`, not just `devel:k8s:admin`), and — once a
[declared vocabulary](../reference/policy.md#vocabulary) puts groups in an
[implies ladder](../taxonomy.md#inheritance) — every hop back to the group
that was actually granted, one direct parent at a time rather than a
root the reader has to trust:
`stage:k8s:viewer ← implied by stage:k8s:operator ← implied by
stage:k8s:admin ← wildcard *:k8s:admin ← directory group sre@example.com`.
The whole chain is already in the one `Explain` answer the page reads —
policy.Held carries the granting key and the direct parent for every
group it names — so the console walks it client-side rather than asking
the server a second time.

What it changes is bootstrap, removals and confirmations — never policy:

- **Connect** a provider by admin consent, a GitHub organisation by its
  owner creating and installing an App, the link App people authorize,
  and a **runner App** per organisation per tier for self-hosted
  runners, and a **Slack workspace** by pasting a throwaway app
  configuration token and sending a workspace owner through Slack's install,
  and a catalogue Slack App the same way. Each genuinely needs a browser and no
  credential of theirs can be obtained as code; what they produce — a refresh
  token, an App's private key, a bot token — is what this process writes for
  itself.
- **Keep records** — and only these: a console channel
  (`_channel.<workspace>.<name>.json`) and a Slack Connect channel
  (`_shared.<name>.json`). They are membership definitions for Slack channels
  fed by directory groups and individual addresses, never by internal groups;
  they are validated against the policy and the connected directories, audited
  (`roster.slack_console_channel.*`, `roster.slack_shared_channel.*`), mirrored
  into a Secret for backup, and never grant access to infrastructure.
- **Archive** a console channel in Slack, opt-in, when forgetting its record.
  Never a Slack Connect channel.
- **Request a pass** (Refresh): a marker in the records ConfigMap, at most one a
  minute per Slack workspace or GitHub organisation.
- **Revoke a session.** A removal, and the lever between sign-out and
  expiry. Disconnecting a provider, an organisation or an App is the same
  kind of removal: it revokes at the other side, then forgets.
- **Confirm** a set of removals the controller held because it concerned
  more than half an organisation, and **import** GitHub links approved
  elsewhere. Both let the controller act on something it could not
  decide alone; neither adds anybody to a group.

It cannot change who is in an internal group. Operator therefore means *may
connect*, *may revoke*, *may confirm*, *may keep Slack channel records* and *may
request a pass*, each over the installation, or over the one directory that owns
the organisation or Slack workspace concerned; everything else is a viewer.

**GitHub** is a page on the internal side, beside clients, because a
GitHub team consumes internal groups the way a client does. It is four
tabs, in the order the work happens. *Overview* says what needs attention
next: a card per organisation, and the people who have not linked, with
their addresses to copy. *Organisations* opens each one — what enabling
it would do in one sentence, removals first, every person with a row
that reads **OK**, **waiting for them** or **needs you** with the
controller's exact state in the tooltip, and each team with a page.
*Apps* holds the link App, every organisation's controller App and every
catalogue App, one row each with a page of its own for its permissions beside
GitHub's, its grants, and the two clicks that create and install it; *Runners*
holds the runner Apps, one per bound organisation per tier.
A person's page shows them on GitHub and, on your own, a button to link
your account; a group's page lists the teams it feeds. A disabled
organisation is still derived every pass, so its page is the dry run an
operator reads before enabling it. Nothing on it writes to GitHub; the
report is read from a ConfigMap the controller writes, and a report that
is missing or unreadable hides none of the bindings.

**Navigation** is the model, in four clusters under *Overview*: **IDENTITY**
(Directories, Directory groups, People, Rules); **ACCESS** (Internal groups,
Clients, Sessions); **SYSTEMS** (GitHub, Slack, one entry each, with tabs of
their own); **ADMIN** (Audit, Settings). **Slack** is *Workspaces* (the
connection, owning directory, team, install state and last pass of each),
*Channels* (every managed channel across workspaces in one table: the
policy's, read-only and *defined in git*, with the internal groups that feed
them; the console's, editable, with their directory groups and mode;
and Slack Connect's, filtered by workspace or kind), *Slack Connect*
(host, sides and per-side state; create and edit), *Discovered* (every
visible channel nothing manages, ordinary and shared, each with Manage) and
*Apps* (the catalogue). The Channels, Slack Connect and Discovered tabs share
one filter bar; every selection is in the address query
(`#/slack/channels?workspace=&kind=&state=&q=`,
`#/slack/connect?host=&side=&state=&q=`,
`#/slack/discovered?workspace=&kind=&visibility=&q=&sort=`), so a filtered view
is a link. Channel states are ok, pending (about to be created, adopted or
accepted), waiting, held, invalid and not reported. **A channel has a page**,
`#/slack/channels/<workspace>/<name>` or by Slack id: one sentence, where it
comes from (every source a link), the state of every person in it and why,
each side of a Slack Connect channel, and its history, which is the audit
trail narrowed to the channel's target. The reverse edges are drawn from the
same reports and records, with no call of their own: a directory group's
page lists the Slack channels it feeds, per workspace, with how its people
stand in each, and the GitHub teams it feeds through the internal groups; a
person's page lists their channels per workspace with the state and reason
(*waiting for them: no Slack account yet*). GitHub is likewise one entry:
*Overview*, *Organisations*, *Apps* and *Runners*. The old addresses
`#/slack-apps` and `#/slack-connect` open the tabs that replaced them.

Every page reads in the same direction, from the identity side toward the
access side, and the two group pages carry the same sections mirrored. The
visual vocabulary has one meaning per form, which is what keeps a
data-dense page readable: a name is a link, monospace when it is an
identifier; a chip is a state and nothing else is; facts are a label over
a value; two-column data is a list and tabular data is a table.

## The GitHub controller

A second process from the same chart, because it holds GitHub App keys
and writes to GitHub, and neither belongs in the login path. It has no
listener and no console of its own.

What each GitHub team should contain is the policy's `github` table:
internal groups per team, in both of GitHub's roles. Which accounts hold
those groups is the console's to answer, and the controller asks it with
its own ServiceAccount token — no exchange in front of a same-cluster
call. A GitHub account is matched to a person by the work addresses GitHub
verified on it, which the person shows by authorizing a link App — GitHub
discloses members' addresses to no organisation outside its Enterprise
Cloud plan — so nobody types a GitHub username, and nobody else keeps a
mapping. Two more ways exist, and neither displaces a link the person
made: an account whose public profile shows a work address the directory
has is matched, because GitHub lets an account publish only a verified
address; and a pairing approved elsewhere is imported through an
operator RPC, after three checks. A self-link is checked on GitHub every
pass, and an account whose link GitHub says is gone leaves the
organisation at once; a profile match or an import holds no token of the
App's and is not re-checked.

The loop is `internal/rails`' (the Slack controller's too): a pass every
interval, and a pass at once when the watch sees a change. Every 30 seconds the
controller hashes its mounted credentials Secret and records ConfigMap, and
reads the `_pass.<organisation>.json` markers an operator's **Refresh** leaves
there. A changed hash, or a marker newer than the last one acted on, wakes the
loop; the markers are never deleted (the volume is read-only), and those that
exist at start are answered by the first pass. The pass is always the full one,
because the reports are published as one document set. The request is rate
limited to one a minute per organisation under the records' version, and
audited.

Every pass derives everything, for every bound organisation, and changes
only those listed in `controllerGithub.config.enabledOrgs`: an organisation is born
disabled, and its report is the dry run an operator reads before enabling
it. Removal is the part that needs one more question than addition.
Absence from a holders list is never evidence — an unreadable workspace
contributes nobody — so each removal is confirmed by asking about that one
address, and done only on an answer the directory vouches for. Somebody
is removed from the organisation only when the directory no longer has
them at all, and never if they are an owner.

It runs joiners, movers and leavers with nobody in the loop, and stops
itself where a person is needed. Nobody is invited past the last free
seat, and nobody at all while the seats cannot be read — which is why an
organisation's App asks for `organization_administration: read`. A pass
whose removals concern more than half an organisation removes nobody
until an operator confirms exactly that set. Owners are added to teams
and promoted, never removed or demoted: reported instead. An address or
login the organisation's `ignore` list names is left alone whatever the
bindings say. Transient trouble — the directory unable to vouch right
now, a change GitHub refused — is retried next pass rather than held,
and two expired invitations stop a third until the person links again.
Outside collaborators are listed.

Every answer the console gives carries the digest of the policy it was
computed under, and the controller changes nothing on an answer under
another policy: a rollout restarts the two at different moments, and
across that gap a team the new policy binds looked to the old console
like one nobody holds. Such a pass is tried again within seconds, not
after an interval: the Service routes some questions to a replica on the
previous policy until that replica has gone, and a whole interval of a
failed report for a rollout that ended seconds later would be a false
alarm. The retries are bounded, so a difference that does not end falls
back to the interval. A failed pass is reported over the last report
with rows, so the page does not blank while passes fail; a restarted
controller takes what it had already recorded from that report, so a
restart is not news in the audit trail.

It writes GitHub and its report through the service, records what it did
to the audit installation as itself, and pushes metrics over OTLP when a
collector is named. Nothing else: no
store of its own, and no Valkey credential, because that store holds
every session and refresh token.

### Reconciler rails

A reconciler is a loop that, every pass and for every target the policy
binds, reads what a system holds, asks the console who should hold it,
decides, acts where the target is enabled, and reports. GitHub
organisations are the first; Slack workspaces are the second. Both are built
on `internal/rails`, which holds what they call with the same meaning, instead
of `internal/githubroster`:

- the pass loop and its backoff: a pass that met a console on another
  policy is tried again within seconds a bounded number of times, then left
  to the interval;
- the directory half: who holds each group and what is true of one address,
  every answer gated by the policy digest, and the removal rule that
  somebody is removed only on an answer the directory vouched for (an
  address not asked, or not vouched for, settles nothing this pass);
- the held-once ledger, so a held row is audited when it becomes held and
  not every pass or after a restart;
- the journal of each target's last good report, so a failed pass reports
  its failure over what was known;
- the confirmation loop (`Confirm`), asked one address at a time under the
  removal rule;
- the removal circuit breaker and its fingerprint, which is the unit of
  operator confirmation: one confirmation satisfies every gate the fingerprint
  covers, and the dry-run switch a target is born behind.

`internal/githubroster` and `internal/slackroster` each own everything shaped
like their system: for GitHub teams, logins, invitations, seats, deriving and
deciding what an organisation should look like, the change calls, status
documents and audit events. The rails take
funcs and small interfaces rather than a generated client, so they import
nothing of either system.

This is deliberately not a reconciler framework. The pieces above are the
ones a second reconciler was shown, by being written, to call identically.
The rest (the row and action types, the pass skeleton, the status document,
the metrics) differ in kind, or are exported names that must stay
identical to what one system already publishes, and a shared shape for
them would be a guess fitted to one system and bent to the other. A piece
moves here when a second reconciler needs it unchanged, not before.

### The Slack reconciler

The second reconciler makes each Slack workspace's channels contain the
people who hold the groups bound to them. See
[Connect a Slack workspace](../connect/slack-workspace.md),
[Slack Connect channels](../connect/slack-connect-channels.md) and
[Slack Apps](../connect/slack-apps-catalogue.md). It lives in
`internal/slackroster`: `reconcile` (the decision, no network), `status` (the
report document the console reads), `connection` (the per-workspace record,
credential, and the console's channel, Slack Connect, confirmation and
pass-request records), `apply` (reading a workspace and carrying out a decision
through the Slack client), `controller` (the loop: the pass, the 30-second
credential and request watch, the directory questions, the guest-side probe and
the metrics) and `app` (the OAuth connect and install flow). The Slack API
client is `internal/slackapp`, with a fake beside it for tests.

**Nothing is declared that the product already knows.** The owner is recorded
in the connection record when the workspace is connected (the installation-wide
operator chooses; an operator of exactly one directory owns what they connect),
the team is recorded at the first install and every later install must match it,
and a person is looked up by the served domains of the owning directory, read
from the console every pass. The policy keeps what is policy: the workspace key,
`channels` and `people`. A policy that still carries `team_id`, `domains` or
`owner` is refused at load, naming where the value now comes from.

**Who is who.** Workspaces are independent. A person is looked up in a
workspace by their address in one of the domains its **owning directory**
serves: the address the directory knows them by, if it is in-domain, otherwise
another address of the same person from `people`. The owner is recorded when
the workspace is connected, and the served domains are read from the console
every pass, so the policy names neither. With no address in them, a person has
no account path in that workspace and is **held** ("no account path in this
workspace"); in a workspace with no owner every person is held ("no owning
directory: set the owner on the console"). A person
with no Slack account yet (`users.lookupByEmail` finds nobody) is held ("no
Slack account yet"), never an error and never created, and the console shows
the row as *waiting for them*, not *needs you*: nobody here has anything to do.
Guests are never invited and never removed; they are reported.

**Two kinds of channel, never mixed.** A *policy channel* is bound in git to
internal groups. A *console channel* is a record fed by directory groups of the
workspace's owning directory and by individual addresses (`members`, each an
active user of that directory); the desired membership is the union, resolved
through nested groups (cycles end, depth and size are bounded, and a read cut
short refuses the channel for the pass). One channel is managed one way: the
console refuses a record for a channel the policy binds (by name, or by adopted
id), and a channel defined both ways is held on both sides — *defined in both
git and the console* — and nothing on it changes until one definition is
removed. There is no take-over from git: to move a channel to the console,
remove it from the policy and Manage it from Discovered.

**Channels.** A channel is bound to groups, and its wanted members are those
groups' holders. It is an idempotent upsert: created when no channel of that
name is visible, public or private as the policy says, and otherwise adopted
**by name**: a public channel is joined, a private one the bot is in is managed,
and each adoption is recorded once (`roster.slack_channel.adopted`). `adopt`
names an id only to disambiguate (a renamed channel, two candidates). A
visibility that disagrees with the policy is held, never changed; an archived
channel of that name is held, never unarchived; and when creating a channel is
refused because its name is taken by a private channel the bot cannot see, it is
held ("invite the bot to it"), never created again under another name.

**Two modes.** Both kinds of channel support both modes, except Slack Connect
channels, which are always `extend`. An `extend` channel (the default) only adds. A `strict`
channel, private only, also removes: it makes membership match the bindings.
It never removes bots or apps, its own bot, deactivated users, guests, people
of another workspace, anybody with no address on the account, or anybody on
the channel's `ignore` list. And a removal happens only when
`rails.Removal` says the directory vouches for it, exactly as on GitHub: an
address not asked about, or not vouched for, settles nothing this pass, so an
unreadable directory removes nobody.

**Two breakers.** Removals over half of a channel's members, or over half of
the workspace's managed members (distinct people, across every channel the
workspace binds), remove nobody unless an operator confirmed the fingerprint
of exactly that set. They are separate gates over the same candidates, each with its own
fingerprint; a confirmation names a fingerprint, so one confirmation satisfies
every gate that fingerprint is the fingerprint of (when a channel's whole
removal set is also the workspace's, one confirmation clears both). It lapses
after 24 hours.

**Leavers.** A person the directory no longer has, still an active member of a
managed channel, is a report row and a `roster.slack_leaver.reported` record,
never an action (a strict channel removes them as any extra).

**Slack Connect channels** are an input list of definitions (name, host, the
workspaces it is shared `with`, sources — directory groups of any connected
directory — and individual addresses, visibility as one bool or per side), not
something the policy declares: the console manages them as records. The
record keeps the channel's Slack id when it was found rather than created. The
host creates the channel and invites each guest workspace's bot; a guest
accepts the pending invitation for that channel from the host's team and
only that. Then each side invites only its own people: a person joins from the
host when they have a host-domain address, otherwise from the first `with`
workspace, in order, where they have one, otherwise the host holds them.
Shared channels are always `extend`. A side waiting for the other is a
`waiting` state, not a hold. A bot that does not list a side is asked once per
pass, by id with `conversations.info`, but only for a channel a record manages,
and only the workspaces Slack names as guests or, when Slack names none, the
workspaces the record names as sides; an expected not-visible answer is logged
at debug, with one `guest-side probe` summary at info. A channel no record
manages is never probed.

**What it never does.** It creates no Slack account, touches no user group,
invites or removes no guest, removes nobody from a public channel, never
converts a channel's visibility, never unarchives, never creates a second
channel under another name, and never removes anyone the directory has not
vouched for. It acts only in workspaces listed in `controllerSlack.config.enabledWorkspaces`; every
other workspace is derived and reported.

**A read is whole or it is nothing.** A missing `users:read.email` scope, a
rate limit that outlasts every retry, a failed page: any of them fails the
whole workspace's read, and nothing is decided or changed on it. An address
never looked up, or a channel member nobody identified, is an error in the
decision too, so a partial read can never look like a workspace in which
nobody has an account.

**What is written.** `status.Workspace` is one versioned JSON document per
workspace: per channel, per person, `ok`, `will-invite`, `will-remove`,
`held` (with the reason), `retrying`, `reported` or `ignored`; the two
breakers; the leavers; and the last pass's time and outcome. A workspace's
connection is two objects for the reason GitHub's is: a record the console
shows, and a credential (client id and secret, bot token) that only the
controller mounts. The token is empty between creating the app and installing
it, which is its own state, and the client secret is kept because a
scope-upgrade reinstall needs it. The report ConfigMap is
`<release>-slack-status`, one `<workspace>.json` key per workspace, created by
the service. The records ConfigMap is `<release>-slack-workspaces`:
`<workspace>.json` (connection, with `owner`; team optional until first
install), `_shared.<name>.json`, `_channel.<workspace>.<name>.json`,
`_confirm.*` and `_pass.*`. A Secret `<release>-slack-records` mirrors exactly
the first three kinds for backup; a start with an empty ConfigMap repopulates it
from the mirror.

## Audit

sluis does not keep its own audit trail. It
records into an installation of [truvity/audit](https://github.com/truvity/audit)
that belongs to this application and runs in its namespace: with
`audit.writer` set it registers its catalogue and sends its records to that
one address, and with `audit.query` set it shows the installation's view as
the console's Audit page; with neither it keeps nothing beyond the log line
every record also is, and has no page. Until 1.26 it kept Elastic Common Schema objects in an
Object-Locked bucket of its own, written and listed by this service; that
was a second audit component, without pseudonymisation, a signed chain,
an index or retention per purpose, and the installation has all of them.
Objects written that way age out under their own lock; nothing migrates
them.

**The catalogue is the model.** [`internal/audit/catalogue/roster.yaml`](../../internal/audit/catalogue/roster.yaml)
declares every action — `roster.person.signed_in`, `roster.token.exchanged`,
`roster.github_member.invited`, … sixty-two of them (catalogue 1.6.0) — with what kind of
operation it is, the framework categories it answers, which profile keeps
it (`security`, every one of them: this service serves one organisation,
and a second copy under a second retention would answer nothing), the
types of its targets (a client, a workspace, an organisation, a team, a
GitHub account, a GitHub App, a Slack workspace, a Slack channel, a Slack user,
a Slack App, a directory group, a directory user), the kinds of actor (a person, recovery, a CI
job, a workload, the service itself), a schema for its data, and how it
reads as a sentence. Every action has one constructor in
[`internal/audit/events.go`](../../internal/audit/events.go), and nothing
else builds a record, so the vocabulary is fixed by the compiler;
`just audit-catalogue` holds the two together with the audit component's
own validator and emitter check. The model this replaced had a free-text
kind, an untyped target that meant a client, a workspace or `@login`
depending on the kind, the actor repeated as the subject, and addresses in
free attributes; the catalogue's validator refuses each of those. A change to
the catalogue needs a new version and its released fixture; an installation
refuses a changed document under a version it already holds.

**Who is who.** The actor is who acted, by kind; the subject is who it
concerns, and differs from the actor as often as not — an operator revokes
a person's sessions, the controller invites a person. A person is named by
the address the directory knows them by, and `security` keeps it in clear,
because a trail of staff whose subjects are pseudonyms answers none of the
questions it exists for; the installation runs no pseudonymisation keys. A
GitHub account is a person's, so its login is treated the same way. No
address is ever data.

**Every record belongs to the installation**, the audit tenant
`@platform`: an installation of sluis serves one organisation, and
its trail is the organisation's own.

**Each process records as itself.** The service, the GitHub controller and the
Slack controller each present their own projected service-account token; the installation
stamps the verified workload as every record's observer. The controller no
longer reports through this service, and the reporter group and RPC that
made that possible are gone: a component that can write to the trail
directly, as itself, needs no one to vouch for it.

An event caused by a request keeps where it came from: the client's
address, its User-Agent, the gateway's `X-Request-Id` and the trace. The
server reads them once, at the outermost handler, and they travel in the
request's context to wherever the record is made — including the token
endpoint's storage, which an OpenID library calls with a context and
nothing else. The address is the peer's unless the deployment says how many
of its own proxies sit in front of the service
(`audit.forwardedForTrustedHops`), counted the way the audit emitter counts
them, with the peer as one: the forwarded chain is then read from the
right, because only the right end is written by those proxies.

**The Audit page reads as the person.** The console forwards the page's
calls to the query service with a token it mints for the person signed in,
through the same decision a token exchange makes, for the installation's
audience, lasting five minutes. No token reaches the browser and there is no
cross-origin call; what anyone may read is the installation's grants', and
every read is recorded there. The page asks the query service which
profiles the person may read.

Recording never fails what is being recorded. A sign-in that could not be
written down still happened, and refusing it because the trail was slow
would turn an audit outage into an access outage: almost every action goes
on a bounded queue in the process before the request completes, and reaches
the writer when it can
([control](../operations/runbook.md#when-the-installation-cannot-be-reached)).

**The one exception is a recovery sign-in, which fails closed.** Its
catalogue entry is `block`: the record is in the installation before the
sign-in succeeds, at the issuer and at the console's own door alike, and
when it cannot be, the sign-in is refused and the refusal recorded.
Recovery is the way in that bypasses the directory, so a recovery that left
no trace is the one gap an auditor most needs to be impossible. It does
make recovery depend on the installation's writer, which is the price; a
deployment with no installation connected does not refuse recovery, because
it has no trail to keep it in.

## The issuer's own HTML

Four things, and they exist for one reason: each runs before there is
anyone to authorize, so none of them can be a console page. Everything
else a person sees is the console.

| | |
|---|---|
| `/login` | the sign-in chooser: one button per provider kind, under the name of the application being signed in to and the host it returns to — all of it from the declared policy and the validated request, none of it from the query string |
| `/logout` | the sign-out a person follows, needing no `id_token_hint` |
| `/signed-out` | where a sign-out lands when the client declares no page of its own |
| a refusal | what `/authorize` and `/end_session` show when they cannot send the person onward |

**The refusals are pages because of where they are reached.** Both
endpoints redirect a browser back to the relying party when they can, and
that is the specification's answer. What is left is the case where there
is nowhere safe to send somebody — an unregistered `redirect_uri`, a
broken `id_token_hint` — so they stay here, looking at whatever gets
written. That used to be the library's `http.Error`: correct, and
unstyled black text on white with nothing on it naming the service they
had reached.

**And these pages have to be re-read when behaviour changes**, because
nothing fails when they go stale. The signed-out page told people their
other consoles kept running *"until those expire"* for two releases after
sign-out started revoking them — it was describing the design it was
written against, at the moment it did the opposite. What caught it was
looking at a conformance screenshot, not a test.

Plain Kubernetes objects in the process's own namespace, read and written
by it. Nothing else is in the loop: no external-secrets operator, no cloud
parameter store, no cache. How a *declared* Secret gets into the namespace
is the deployment's business.

A workspace is two objects because the record and the credential have
different readers: the record is what the console shows, the credential is
written once and read once, at the next start. Splitting them keeps a
secret out of the type the console handles, and makes the failure modes
independent — a record whose credential has gone is a workspace with no
reader, which is reported as unhealthy, rather than a process that refuses
to start. The credentials of every console-connected workspace share one
Secret, `<release>-workspace-credentials`, a key per workspace: a
per-workspace object's name carries a hash of an id no deployment knows
in advance, so nothing outside the service could have selected them one
by one.

Start-up has three cases. A workspace the values declare is opened from
what the deployment mounts. A workspace whose stored record says it was
declared, and which the values no longer mention, has been taken out of
the deployment: its record is deleted, because leaving it would be a
directory nobody could disconnect. Everything else was connected in the
console and is opened from the credential stored beside it — and if that
credential is missing or refused, the process says so and carries on,
because refusing to start would take every other directory down with it.

Each credential carries a copy of its record, without its health, so the
Secrets alone restore a namespace: start-up puts back every workspace
ConfigMap and every GitHub record that is missing beside a credential.
The backup is therefore a copy of five named Secrets — the workspace
credentials, the GitHub Apps, the links, the runner Apps, the catalogue
Apps — and, for Slack, `<release>-slack-credentials` and the records mirror
`<release>-slack-records` (written by `slackState.push`); the catalogue Slack
Apps' `<release>-slack-catalogue-apps` is one more. A
deployment makes with a `PushSecret` each; nothing in the service depends
on the copy. Without one, the recovery for a lost workspace credential
is **Reconnect**, and a declared Secret is re-delivered by whatever
declared it. The console never returns secret material, the logs never
print it, and **Disconnect** revokes the token at the backend before the
credential is deleted.

The GitHub controller's report is one more object here,
`<release>-github-status`. The **service** creates it at start and the
controller only ever replaces its data: Kubernetes RBAC cannot narrow
`create` to a name, so a controller that created its own report would
need to be allowed to create any ConfigMap in this namespace — including
one that reads as a workspace record. It is not rendered by the chart
either, because a ConfigMap whose data a controller rewrites is one a
GitOps sync reverts.

The Slack controller's report is `<release>-slack-status`, created by the
service for the same reason.

A connected GitHub organisation is two objects for the reason a workspace
is: a record in `<release>-github-orgs` that the console shows, and a
credential — the App's private key, with a copy of the record beside it
— in `<release>-github-apps`, the link App's under `_link.json`. One
Secret for every organisation rather than one each, so that the
controller mounts it by name as a volume and holds no permission to read
it through the API. This process reads a key back for one thing:
uninstalling the App on Disconnect. People's links, tokens included,
are `<release>-github-links`, the one Secret the controller's Role may
update, by name, as it checks them. The runner Apps are
`<release>-github-runner-apps`: an installed App is three keys named as
the runner scale set reads them, so a deployment copies them to its
runners without reshaping a document, and until the App is installed its
key sits under another name, so a copy taken in between never hands
runners an App they cannot register with. The catalogue Apps — Apps a
deployment declares as data in its values — are
`<release>-github-catalogue-apps` in the same shape, keyed by catalogue
id rather than by tier and organisation; this process reads a key back
to ask GitHub, as the App, whether the App and its installation still
hold what was declared, and to uninstall on Disconnect.

The signing key is a file, never read through the API, so a compromise of
this process cannot become a read of every credential in its namespace.
Confidential clients' secrets are files for the same reason, one per
client id.

The file is polled, not read once at start: cert-manager's
`rotationPolicy: Always` means a renewal is a new key, and a process that
only reads it at boot would keep signing with the old one until it next
restarts, which for a certificate renewed every year could be a long
time. A key ring keeps every key this replica has published, live or
retiring — the new one is in the JWKS the moment it is seen, signing
starts only once every other replica has had time to notice and publish
it too, and the previous key stays published for as long as a token it
signed can still be presented. The schedule for a key is decided once and
shared through the same store sessions already use, so a replica that
restarts mid-rotation does not forget a key still inside its overlap.

## Recovery

The way in on the day no directory can vouch for anybody. It exists
because of a deadlock that is otherwise complete: a console asks for a
token, the answer needs the directory, the directory is not connected yet,
and it is connected *from* that console.

The proof is a ServiceAccount token minted for a mandatory audience and
checked by the API server with a **TokenReview** — the one thing left that
asks the cluster anything, and deliberately so: on the day everything else
is broken it should depend on nothing but the API server. Nothing is
stored. The authority is the cluster's RBAC: who may mint a token for that
account, revocable by removing a binding and landed in the audit log.

It grants nothing by itself. A recovered sign-in completes as the
ServiceAccount *subject*, and only a `service_account` matcher in the
policy puts that subject in a group.

It is also the one thing the audit trail can refuse: a recovery sign-in
is written durably before it completes, and refused when it cannot be
(see [Audit](#audit)).

## Failure semantics

| Situation | What consumers and operators see |
|---|---|
| Probe failed, snapshot still young | answers from the snapshot, `authoritative=false` |
| Snapshot older than the freshness window | same |
| Full refresh failed a page | old snapshot kept; nothing partial is ever served |
| Domain claimed by two workspaces | `authoritative=false` for that domain on both |
| Address in no served domain | `in_domain=false`: no opinion |
| Account missing from the snapshot | one live read first; `found=false` only after the backend said so |
| Valkey unreachable | the replica leaves readiness and says which dependency; sessions and snapshots are unavailable until it returns |
| Credential revoked or admin suspended | probe fails → provisional; reconnect is the recovery |
| A request would wait on the directory | it does not: the work runs detached and the answer is *first snapshot pending* |
| A policy the process refuses to load | the new pod does not start and the previous pods keep serving the previous policy |
| a GitHub pass fails | the last report with rows stands; the pass is retried next interval; nothing is removed on a failed read |
| the console answers a controller under another policy | the pass changes nothing and is tried again within seconds, six times at most before the interval resumes |
| a Slack workspace is not connected or not installed yet | that workspace reports a `waiting` pass with no error; nothing else is affected |
| a Slack pass cannot read the workspace whole, or the directory cannot be read | the report is kept with the failure on it; nothing is decided or changed on a partial read, and nobody is removed |
| a removal set is over half of a channel or of the workspace's managed members | nobody in that set is removed until an operator confirms that exact fingerprint (valid 24 hours; one confirmation covers every gate it fits) |
| a channel is defined in both git and the console | held on both sides, unchanged, until one definition is removed |
| The whole installation is down | no new sign-ins; existing sessions and tokens live to expiry; recovery is by cluster proof |

The rule under all of them: **access is removed only on an authoritative
answer.** Everything that can go wrong degrades to *provisional*, never to
"gone".

## Appendix: what was removed, and why

Each of these shipped and was taken out. They are listed so that nobody
adds one back without a reason.

| Removed | Why |
|---|---|
| the directory's API listener, and the TokenReview between the two services | there was one consumer and it is now the same process. The endpoint returns when a second consumer exists |
| the console layer of the policy, and the `memberships` table | a second source of truth beside git, and a merge to reconcile them. The key is refused now, not ignored: one silently dropped is a grant somebody wrote, reviewed and merged that never took effect |
| `SetOAuthClient` | the client is a Secret, delivered the way every other credential in the estate is |
| the `/account` page | it was here because it had to be same-origin with the session service; the console is same-origin and now the same process, and already shows both halves |
| the device flow | for a machine with no browser. Both headless cases here — a CI job and a workload — are token exchange |
| client credentials | a machine with a stored secret, which is the thing this design exists not to have |
| JWT bearer (RFC 7523) | token exchange with a different spelling, and two ways to say one thing is two things to keep truthful |
| introspection (RFC 7662) | never applied: these are JWTs, verified offline against the key set |
| dynamic client registration (RFC 7591) | an endpoint that mints trust is not carried, and the Model Context Protocol deprecated DCR in its 2026-07-28 revision anyway. A client that this installation does not deploy identifies itself with a **Client ID Metadata Document** instead: no endpoint, no stored registration, nothing that accumulates, and an allow-list of origins keeps the answer readable in the repository — the set of origins rather than the set of clients |
| the implicit and hybrid flows | superseded by code with PKCE, which is what PKCE exists for |
| take over from git (`supersedes_policy`, v1.47.0, removed v1.48.0) | a migration aid that made one channel two definitions. A channel defined in both places is now held; the field is ignored on read and never written |
| `slack.workspaces.<key>.team_id`, `.domains`, `.owner` and `github.<org>.owner` (v1.41.0, removed v1.42.0) | each is known at run time; declaring it twice was drift. Refused at load with the new source named |
| a Slack Connect record's `from` internal groups (v1.41.0, replaced v1.45.0) | Slack Connect channels are fed by directory groups; a record with internal groups is listed `invalid` |
| guest-side probe of every shared channel (v1.46.1, narrowed v1.49.1) | it spent a call per other workspace per unmanaged channel per pass; only managed channels are probed |
| TokenReview for workload exchange | it works on one cluster and would need a kubeconfig per cluster for the rest. A published key set needs none. It stays for recovery alone |

Not served, and never was: the session-management iframe, front-channel
logout, PAR, DPoP, mTLS and CIBA. Each is surface without a consumer.

Back-channel logout was on that list through 0.15, and the reason it
left is worth naming. Signing out revokes the sessions immediately, but
a proxied console only learns that at its next refresh — so it keeps
serving for up to `cookie_refresh`, a minute on the shipped proxy chart.
Back-channel logout closes that window for a client that runs its own
session and opts in; oauth2-proxy cannot consume it, because it keeps
each session under a key only the browser's cookie holds, so for a
proxied console the refresh interval remains the whole dial, and it is
bounded by a setting we choose.

## Build

`devbox shell`, then `just check`. The chart is `charts/sluis`.
For a console with no OpenID flow of its own, use gateway-native OIDC
on Envoy Gateway, or run upstream oauth2-proxy on other gateways
(removed from publication in v1.32.0;
[ADR 0003](../decisions/0003-deprecate-access-proxy.md); see
[design/access-proxy.md](access-proxy.md) for the recipe).
