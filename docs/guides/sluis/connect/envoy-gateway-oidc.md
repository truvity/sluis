# Front a console with Envoy Gateway's own OIDC filter

**Anchor:** the issuer; the console runs no OpenID flow of its own —
Envoy Gateway's `SecurityPolicy` runs it, attached to the console's own
`HTTPRoute`. Read [choosing-native-or-gateway-oidc.md](choosing-native-or-gateway-oidc.md)
first if you have not already decided this is the shape you want; this
page is only how to build it, and where it bites.

Every field name and default below is checked against Envoy Gateway
**v1.9**'s own API types
([`api/v1alpha1/oidc_types.go`](https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/blob/release/v1.9/api/v1alpha1/oidc_types.go),
[`jwt_types.go`](https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/blob/release/v1.9/api/v1alpha1/jwt_types.go),
[`authorization_types.go`](https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/blob/release/v1.9/api/v1alpha1/authorization_types.go))
and, for the traps, its translator
([`internal/xds/translator/utils.go`](https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/blob/release/v1.9/internal/xds/translator/utils.go)) —
verify field names against a newer release before copying this on one.

## The client row

```yaml
clients:
  myconsole.example.internal:
    kind: confidential          # the filter holds the secret and redeems the code itself
    secret: myconsole-oidc-client
    display_name: My Console
    description: the team's dashboard
    redirects:  [https://myconsole.example.internal/oauth2/callback]
    signed_out: [https://myconsole.example.internal/]
    requires:   [all:myconsole:operator, all:myconsole:viewer]
    ttl_cap: 15m
    # signing_alg: RS256   # only if something downstream reads the forwarded
                            # ID token with a fixed-algorithm verifier
```

`kind: confidential` for the same reason a proxy client is
confidential: the filter, not the browser, holds the secret and redeems
the authorization code
([reference/policy-clients.md#clients](../../../reference/sluis/policy-clients.md#clients)).
`requires` is checked at sign-in and again at every refresh — the second
check is why a grant withdrawn after a token was issued still ends at
the next refresh rather than living out the token's full lifetime
([design](../../../concepts/sluis/sessions.md#who-may-open-which-console)).
`ttl_cap` is the whole of this shape's revocation story, because there is
no Back-Channel Logout receiver here (below) — see
[Trap 1](#trap-1-per-request-refresh-races-rotating-refresh-tokens) before
setting it very short.

## The app must own an `HTTPRoute`

A `SecurityPolicy` targets a `Gateway`, a `ListenerSet`, an `HTTPRoute`, a
`GRPCRoute` or a `TCPRoute` — never a hostname or a path by itself. Attach
it to a `Gateway` or a shared `ListenerSet` and it fronts *everything*
routed through that listener, which is very rarely what one console
wants. So the console's own chart renders its own `HTTPRoute`, and the
policy's `targetRefs` names that route — the same reason this issuer's
own chart gives the console's path a second `HTTPRoute` rather than
sharing the one carrying `/token` and `/keys`
([reference/configuration.md](../../../reference/sluis/configuration.md)).

## The `SecurityPolicy`

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: myconsole-oidc
  namespace: myconsole
spec:
  targetRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: HTTPRoute
      name: myconsole
  oidc:
    provider:
      issuer: https://issuer.example.internal
      authorizationEndpoint: https://issuer.example.internal/authorize
      tokenEndpoint: https://issuer.example.internal/token
      endSessionEndpoint: https://issuer.example.internal/end_session
    clientID: myconsole.example.internal
    clientSecret:
      group: ""
      kind: Secret
      name: myconsole-oidc-client
    redirectURL: https://myconsole.example.internal/oauth2/callback
    logoutPath: /oauth2/sign_out
    refreshToken: true
    forwardAccessToken: true
  jwt:
    providers:
      - name: myconsole-idtoken
        issuer: https://issuer.example.internal
        remoteJWKS:
          uri: https://issuer.example.internal/keys
          cacheDuration: 5m
        extractFrom:
          headers:
            - name: x-id-token
        claimToHeaders:
          - header: x-groups
            claim: groups
  authorization:
    defaultAction: Deny
    rules:
      - name: operators-and-viewers
        action: Allow
        principal:
          jwt:
            provider: myconsole-idtoken
            claims:
              - name: groups
                valueType: StringArray
                values: [all:myconsole:operator, all:myconsole:viewer]
```

A few fields worth explaining rather than copying blind:

- **`oidc.provider`** takes `authorizationEndpoint` and `tokenEndpoint`
  explicitly here on purpose, not because they are required — either is
  discovered from `issuer`'s `.well-known/openid-configuration` when left
  unset. **`endSessionEndpoint` is only auto-discovered when you leave
  *both* of the other two unset too** — the source comment says so
  plainly: state it by hand the moment you state the other two, or a
  console that logs a person out locally never ends their SSO session at
  the issuer, and nothing in the render tells you it didn't.
- **`clientSecret`** is a `SecretObjectReference` — `name` mandatory,
  `group` and `kind` optional and defaulted (`""` for the core API group,
  `Secret`). Write them anyway: a GitOps controller that diffs rendered
  manifests against live state reads an omitted field as drift the
  moment the API server fills it in.
- **`refreshToken: true`** is also the library default — stating it is
  for the reader, not the render — and it is what makes
  [Trap 1](#trap-1-per-request-refresh-races-rotating-refresh-tokens)
  possible at all: no refresh, no race, but also no session that outlives
  its first access token.
- **`forwardAccessToken: true`** puts the issuer's access token in the
  upstream `Authorization` header, which is what an app's own backend
  reads with the Go or TypeScript `identity` verifier exactly as it would
  behind a gateway proxy
  ([connect/console-app.md](console-app.md)).
- **The `jwt` block is not there to authenticate the request again** —
  `oidc` already did that. It exists so `groups` can be read out of a
  **header** rather than out of a cookie (see
  [Trap 3](#trap-3-cookie-size)), and so `authorization` can gate on it.
  `extractFrom.headers` names `x-id-token`, not `Authorization`, because
  `Authorization` already carries the forwarded access token above, and
  the default extraction point for a JWT provider **is** `Authorization`
  — naming a header of its own is what keeps the two from reading each
  other's token. Reaching `x-id-token` in the first place needs one more
  field this example leans on implicitly: `oidc.forwardIDToken.header:
  x-id-token` (omitted above for brevity — add it, or the JWT provider
  has nothing to extract). The schema itself refuses the one adjacent
  mistake: `forwardIDToken.header` may not be `Authorization` while
  `forwardAccessToken` is `true` — the validation error names both
  fields if you try.
- **`valueType: StringArray` on the `groups` claim is not optional in
  practice, only in the schema.** The field defaults to `String`, which
  matches a single scalar claim exactly — never this issuer's `groups`,
  which is always a flat array of internal group names
  ([reference/policy-groups.md#groups-to-token-by-deep-merge](../../../reference/sluis/policy-groups.md#groups-to-token-by-deep-merge)).
  Leave it out and the rule silently never matches, because a
  string-typed match against an array claim is not the same comparison.
- **`authorization.defaultAction: Deny`** is also the library default
  when neither `rules` nor `defaultAction` is set — stated here so a
  reader does not have to know that to trust the policy denies anyone
  outside the one `Allow` rule.

## Sign-out

The filter serves `logoutPath` (default `/logout` if you don't set one;
this example moves it to `/oauth2/sign_out` only to keep a link a former
console already had under the removed `access-proxy` chart). Visiting it clears the filter's own
cookies, and — because `endSessionEndpoint` is set above — redirects on
to the issuer's own sign-out, ending that person's SSO session too. That
half is real RP-initiated logout, and it works today.

**What it does not do is receive one.** There is no Back-Channel Logout
receiver behind this filter — no field in the `SecurityPolicy` schema
takes a `backchannel_logout_uri`, and nothing here could open a session
that lives entirely in an encrypted browser cookie even if one existed.
So an operator's revoke somewhere else — the console's *Revoke a session*
or *sign out everywhere*, a directory suspension — reaches this console
only at its next refresh, bounded by the access token's own lifetime and
the client's `ttl_cap`
([design](../../../concepts/sluis/back-channel-logout.md)).
That is the shape the removed `access-proxy` chart had, at the shorter of
the two dials — this filter's own refresh cadence versus this client's
`ttl_cap` — rather than a fixed one-minute `session.refresh`
([oauth2-proxy recipe](oauth2-proxy.md)).

## Traps

### Trap 1: per-request refresh races rotating refresh tokens

**Symptom:** an intermittent sign-in loop or a spurious 401 under load,
worse with more replicas of the gateway.

Envoy's OAuth2 filter refreshes per request, independently on every
replica, and a rotating refresh token is single-use: two concurrent
requests on two replicas can each try to redeem the same refresh token
within the same second. The issuer tolerates a short grace window for
exactly this reason
([ADR 0001](../../../decisions/0001-sessions-and-an-absolute-limit.md)); a replay
after it ends the session
([refresh token reuse](../../../concepts/sluis/sessions.md#refresh-token-reuse)). **Fix:**
never give a client fronted this way a very short `ttl_cap` (a minute or
two) — it does not tighten revocation meaningfully at this shape's own
floor, and it multiplies how often this race is tried.

### Trap 2: cluster-name collision

**Symptom:** the OIDC token endpoint and the JWT `remoteJWKS` share one
host, and a setting given to only one of them — a longer request
timeout, a retry policy, a client TLS bundle — silently never applies to
whichever of the two lost.

Verified against the v1.9 translator: with no explicit `backendRefs`,
both `oidc.provider`'s token endpoint and `jwt.providers[].remoteJWKS`
resolve to an implicit cluster named `clusterName(host, port)` —
literally the host with dots turned to underscores, plus the port
(`internal/xds/translator/utils.go`). Same issuer host, same port, same
derived name: **one Envoy cluster serves both.** Whichever backend's
settings are translated first wins the registration; the second call to
create a cluster of the same name is a documented no-op
(`addXdsCluster`: "if the cluster already exists, it skips adding the
cluster"). The tell is exactly that: the cluster's connection options
stay whatever the first side set, and changing the *other* side's
`backendSettings` in the policy renders successfully and does nothing.

**Fix:** give the JWKS side its own `backendRefs` (or state identical
`backendSettings` on both, so it does not matter which one wins):

```yaml
jwt:
  providers:
    - name: myconsole-idtoken
      remoteJWKS:
        uri: https://issuer.example.internal/keys
        cacheDuration: 5m
        backendRefs:
          - name: sluis
            port: 443
```

### Trap 3: cookie size

Tokens ride in cookies the filter names for you
(`AccessToken-<uid>`, `IdToken-<uid>`), and browsers cap a single cookie
around 4 KB. A large `groups` claim pushes toward that ceiling faster
than anything else in the token, because nothing else here grows with
the size of the installation. Two mitigations, not one:

- fewer groups per audience — the per-audience `groups` scoping this
  repository has decided and not yet shipped
  ([ADR 0006](../../../decisions/0006-groups-claim-scoped-per-audience.md));
  ask what stage it is at before assuming it is live;
- forward the ID token in a **header** rather than reading it from the
  cookie downstream — `oidc.forwardIDToken.header`, read by the `jwt`
  block's `extractFrom` above, is exactly that: the claims the app needs
  travel once, on the request, and never touch the browser's own cookie
  jar at all.

### Trap 4: fail-open on misconfiguration

A `SecurityPolicy` that does not attach to the route you meant leaves
that console **open** — this is a named caveat, not a hypothetical
([ADR 0001](../../../decisions/0001-sessions-and-an-absolute-limit.md)).
**Verify with an unauthenticated request**, every time the policy or the
route changes:

```sh
curl -sD - -o /dev/null https://myconsole.example.internal/
```

A `302` to the issuer's `authorizationEndpoint` is the policy working. A
`200` is the policy not attached at all.

### Trap 5: leftover paths from a former oauth2-proxy

`/oauth2/sign_out` and `/oauth2/start` are oauth2-proxy's own paths (as
its own docs name them), not Envoy Gateway's. This filter serves **no
sign-in path at all** — loading any protected page is what redirects to
the issuer, because there is no separate "start" step — and its own
logout path defaults to `/logout`, not `/oauth2/sign_out`, unless you
move it as this page's example does. A console migrated off
`access-proxy` that still links `/oauth2/start` anywhere is linking a
path nothing here serves.

### Trap 6: declare defaults explicitly

`cacheDuration` on `remoteJWKS` defaults to `300s` if you leave it out;
`clientSecret`'s `group` and `kind` default to `""` and `Secret`. Both
are exactly what this example already writes out, and for the reason
[the `SecretObjectReference` note above](#the-securitypolicy) gives: a
GitOps controller diffing rendered YAML against a live object sees a
field the API server filled in as drift, forever, if the rendered
manifest never named it.

## Verify it works

1. **Unauthenticated → redirect.** `curl -sD - -o /dev/null
   https://myconsole.example.internal/` returns `302` to
   `authorizationEndpoint`, never `200` ([Trap 4](#trap-4-fail-open-on-misconfiguration)).
2. **Sign in once → one issuer session.** After completing the flow,
   the issuer's own console lists exactly one session for that identity
   and client, not one per tab.
3. **After `ttl_cap` elapses, still signed in.** Reload past the cap:
   the filter's background refresh should renew silently, with no
   redirect back to the login page.
4. **Logout path → the issuer session ends.** Visit the configured
   `logoutPath`; the issuer's own session listing for that identity
   should drop this client's session, and a fresh unauthenticated
   request to *another* console signed in under the same SSO session
   should now prompt for a password rather than completing silently.
