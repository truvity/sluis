# Doctrine

The design rules: what this repository owns and what the installation
that consumes it owns, and the reasons for the shape. The test for
whether something belongs here: *why is it like this, and would a change
fit.* This page is an index; the pages below hold the argument. For a map
of every page in the repository, not just these, see
[index.md](../index.md).

- [why.md](why.md) — the situation it starts from, the problems it
  solves, and the principles every design question is decided by
- [concepts.md](concepts.md) — the words used precisely
- [architecture.md](architecture.md) — every piece and how it connects,
  and [who owns what](architecture.md#who-owns-what): sluis, the
  directories, the relying parties
- [design/trust.md](trust.md) — two anchors and one vocabulary of
  internal groups: the rule under everything
- [design/sluis.md](design.md) — one process, the
  directory model, freshness, sessions, the console, the GitHub and
  Slack controllers and the rails they share, the audit trail
- [design/access-proxy.md](../how-to/connect/oauth2-proxy.md) — why the proxy is
  upstream oauth2-proxy in a chart and no code of ours
- [design/sluisctl.md](sluisctl.md) — why a CLI at all, the
  GitHub Action, and the credential broker's list of decisions it does
  not make
- [design/libraries.md](../reference/libraries.md) — the Go module and the
  TypeScript package, and the whoami contract between them
- [integrations.md](integrations.md) — every integration, case by case
- [development/extending.md](../how-to/extend.md) — where something
  new plugs in, and what it must ship with
- [decisions/](../decisions/README.md) — the accepted decisions this doctrine
  follows from, one record per decision, with what was weighed against it
- the Slack rules that decide design questions, each its own record:
  [0017](../decisions/0017-the-slack-reconciler-membership-only.md) the Slack
  reconciler's scope (membership only),
  [0018](../decisions/0018-do-not-configure-what-the-product-knows.md) do not
  configure what the product already knows,
  [0019](../decisions/0019-two-kinds-of-slack-channel-never-mixed.md) two kinds of
  channel, never mixed
