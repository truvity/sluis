// Package backend is the contract a directory backend implements:
// read-only access to one tenant's accounts, groups and domains, plus the
// credential handling that gets there.
//
// Every read is a read. A backend never writes to the directory; the one
// mutating call is [Backend.Revoke], which invalidates the hub's own
// credential at the backend when a workspace is disconnected.
//
// Google Workspace is the first implementation. A second backend
// (Microsoft Entra) implements this same interface, and nothing above this
// package knows which one it is talking to — see
// docs/guides/sluis/extend.md.
