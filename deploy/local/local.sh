# Inputs, from the environment and never from the repository:
#   SLUIS_UPSTREAM_TARGET    host:port of the upstream identity provider, which the sidecar of the adapter forwards to
#   SLUIS_KEYCLOAK_SECRETS   a file with SLUIS_LOCAL_CLIENT_SECRET, and the realm's bootstrap administrator
#                            (KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME and _PASSWORD) to read the test users' sub (default:
#                            $SLUIS_BUILD_DIR/keycloak-secrets.env)
#   SLUIS_LOCAL_PORT         the loopback port of the forwarder (default 8443)
#   COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME     the Compose project (default sluis-local); a second project on one machine sets this, a
#                            SLUIS_LOCAL_PORT and a SLUIS_LOCAL_TAG of its own, so that it leaves the first alone
#   SLUIS_LOCAL_TAG          the tag of the images this project builds (default dev)
#   SLUIS_LOCAL_IMAGES       build (default): build the executables and the images from this checkout; release: run the
#                            images of a release, pulled from the registry, and build nothing. The release needs
#                            SLUIS_LOCAL_VERSION (the version of the release, 2.0.0-alpha.1, without the v) or
#                            SLUIS_RELEASE_IMAGES (the release-images.txt of the release, a file or an https URL, which pins
#                            every image by its digest); SLUIS_IMAGE_PREFIX moves the namespace from ghcr.io/truvity/sluis
#   SLUIS_LOCAL_SUBNET       the subnet of the project's network (default: a free /24 of 10.99.0.0/16, chosen from the project
#                            name and kept while the project's network exists; see default_subnet). Set it where the
#                            host's firewall lets only some subnets reach the upstream
# The state of a run (the CA, the publisher key, the signed config, the subjects of the test users, the credentials) is
# below .cache/local and is deleted by `down`; the volumes go with it.
#
# The KeyPlan lists the wrapping keys that may receive a wrap of a data key (ADR 0006, "Who may receive a wrap"), and a
# software key is made at the first start, so `up` has two phases. The first start signs the KeyPlan with an empty list
# and starts key@ with what it needs. No actor can have a data key yet (key@ makes none for a key that is not listed), so
# the rest waits. Then `up` asks key@ for the thumbprint of its wrapping key (`key check`), keeps it in $state/recipients,
# signs the KeyPlan again with it, puts the document in the config volume and waits until key@ sees its key in the list.
# Then it starts everything else. A later `up` of the same run signs the list at once and has one phase. The committed
# source, tests/installations/local/config/key-plan.yaml, never holds a thumbprint.
