/** sluis's consumer half, for a Node service behind the gateway.

 * with this service's own client id, and it turns the token the gateway
 * forwards into the caller — who they are, what the directory calls them,
 * and the internal groups the policy put them in. No group is re-mapped
 * anywhere: the name in the policy is the name in the token is the name in
 * the role check.
 *
 * And the same endpoint: `whoami` answers the browser package's
 * `fetchIdentity()` with the body Go's `WhoAmI` writes, so a console
 * renders the caller the same way whichever language serves it.
 *
 * Only the issuer anchor is here. A ServiceAccount token from the pod next
 * door is Go's `Cluster`, which needs the Kubernetes API; a Node service
 * reaches this one through the issuer like anything further away. */
