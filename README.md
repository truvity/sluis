# sluis

sluis is an OpenID Connect issuer for workforce access. It signs people in against your corporate directory, turns groups into tokens under one reviewed policy file, and trades the proofs CI jobs and workloads already hold for short-lived credentials. One audit trail records every decision.

## What you get

| Capability | What it does | Read |
|---|---|---|
| One issuer, one policy | One `iss`, one policy file in git, one flat `groups` claim. `git log` is the history of access. | [why sluis exists](docs/concepts/sluis/why.md) |
| Sign-in through your directory | People sign in with Google Workspace and receive their groups. Passwords and MFA stay with the directory. | [Google Workspace](docs/guides/sluis/connect/google-workspace.md) |
| Token exchange (RFC 8693) | CI jobs, ServiceAccounts and AWS roles trade the proof they hold for short-lived AWS, GitHub, Kubernetes or Cloudflare credentials. No stored secret. | [verify and issue](docs/concepts/sluis/verify-and-issue.md) |
| Membership that follows groups | GitHub teams and Slack channels are reconciled from resolved groups. A failed probe or stale snapshot never removes anyone. | [directory model](docs/concepts/sluis/directory-model.md) |
| MCP authorization | A resource proxy puts a stock MCP server behind sluis. Clients identify themselves with Client ID Metadata Documents. | [MCP server](docs/guides/sluis/connect/mcp.md) |
| A strict client model | Public, confidential and exchange clients. PKCE is required for public clients, and per client with `pkce: required`. | [clients](docs/reference/sluis/policy-clients.md) |
| Recovery without the directory | A recovery account signs in with SRP-6a, so the password never crosses the wire. An operator can turn it off. | [recovery](docs/concepts/sluis/recovery.md) |
| A hardened web surface | HSTS, a content security policy, a sign-out that asks first and per-source throttling. Each refusal log names the path, client and user agent. | [safety](docs/concepts/sluis/safety.md) |
| An audit trail | Records written once, sealed, searchable and verifiable by an auditor. | [audit](docs/concepts/audit/README.md) |
| Provable backups | Age-encrypted backups. A restore checks a backup against the sealed audit trail. | [back up and restore](docs/guides/sluis/operate/back-up-on-layout-v5.md) |
| Verifiable releases | Keyless cosign signatures, provenance and SBOM attestations, signed checksums and `hack/release-verify.sh`. | [verify a release](docs/guides/sluis/operate/verify-a-release.md) |

| AWS Lambda | One function per module ([ADR 0071](docs/decisions/0071-least-privilege-modules-one-credential-holder-per-function.md)): issuer, GitHub, Slack, Google, Cloudflare minter, backup and restore. DynamoDB, S3, SSM and KMS. Deployed with the Pulumi library. | [tutorial](docs/get-started/sluis/aws-lambda.md) |
| Kubernetes with AWS storage | The issuer as a pod from the Helm chart, state in DynamoDB and S3, signing in KMS. | [tutorial](docs/get-started/sluis/kubernetes-aws.md) |
| An existing Kubernetes installation | The earlier store on Kubernetes objects and Valkey. | [tutorial](docs/get-started/sluis/kubernetes-legacy-store.md) |

## Who it is for

Platform teams that run many systems from one directory.

## The model

A policy file maps directory groups to access everywhere ([concepts](docs/concepts/sluis/concepts.md)).
